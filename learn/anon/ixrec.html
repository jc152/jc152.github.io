<p>The Japanese language is awesome.</p>

<p>It also has one of the highest learning curves for (popular) modern languages, probably only rivaled by Chinese and English.  It's especially hard for Westerners who don't know any Eastern languages already, since the way of thinking that Japanese relies on is just so alien to them.</p>

<p>At the same time, there are a lot of people, like me, who passionately consume one or more facets of Japan's pop culture (arguably a menagerie of worldwide cult hits).  This translates into droves of people with a strong personal desire to learn the language.</p>

<p>So, I've been studying Japanese in one form or another for over five years now, and I've spent at least two of those years doing amateur translations of visual novels and trying to help others learn the language themselves.</p>

<p>Here are a few of my favorite things about Japanese as a language: It looks and sounds beautiful, it's extremely intuitive (once you're fluent), its lexicon has several precise but abstract words English lacks, there are countless ways of expressing one's mood or personality or relationship to others without rephrasing anything, and virtually anything can be left implied so you never have to mince words.</p>

<p>The corresponding downsides include an insane learning curve (half the pros I just listed are confusing as hell to most Westerners), a ton of homophones, and an incredibly high reliance on context.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<h4 id="Why this guide">Why this guide?</h4>

<p>Most books intended to help someone learn a foreign language are quite useless. Often, this is because few people actually want to put in the time and effort to properly learn a language, so the only way to write a book that appeals to them is to present very simplisitic and incomplete material. Other times, it comes down to the fact that teaching a language is very hard to do, and cannot be taught the same way most school subjects are.</p>

<p>There are a number of serious but painfully common mistakes made as a result of trying to teach languages like an ordinary subject. The big one is that they never expect you to use a dictionary and "source material" (e.g., an actual book written in Japanese) to gain experience with the language. Instead, many classes and books will try to build your vocabulary using lists (often with misleadingly simple definitions) and teach you grammar via snowclones (e.g., "_に_を言う" means "to tell _ that _"), which can only ever hope to cover the simplest of sentences.</p>

<p>Of course, it doesn't have to be as bad as I made it sound in the last paragraph. Tae Kim's guide, for instance, does a pretty good job keeping these disadvantages to a minimum. Still, in my opinion, being newbie-friendly is worth sacrificing in order to provide information that's as close to being genuinely accurate and comprehensive as possible. And that's what I tried to do.</p>

<p>The upshot of this is that my guide expects you to put a lot of effort into studying Japanese, and in return you can trust it to never use any misleading simplifications or omit anything you need to know. In theory, this guide covers everything you need to know about Japanese, other than what you'll find in a dictionary or get a feel for just by reading for years yourself.</p>

<p>Some people absolutely love this approach. Others find it intimidating and might be better off using a guide like Tae Kim's until they feel more confident. It's absolutely fine if you want to do that, as long as you are aware that such guides cannot avoid some amount of oversimplification or incompleteness in order to be that approachable, so take their lists and/or explanations with a grain of salt. And of course, there's no reason you can't use my guide in conjunction with others.</p>

<p>Incidentally, my main goal for improving this guide in the future (aside from adding more random entries to Confusing Vocabulary) is to try and make it a little more newbie-friendly without sacrificing the informational content. For this version, I've added some sections that dissect some source material for you, which should make things less intimidating.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<h4 id="How do I study Japanese using this guide">How do I study Japanese using this guide?</h4>
<p></p>

<p>Like most langauges, you must learn the Japanese alphabets (kana) first. There is absolutely no point attempting to do anything else until you have memorized them. As you might expect, reading the <a class="underscore" href="#Alphabets">Alphabets</a> section will help, since it contains a lot of other random information you ought to know in addition to simply what sound each kana corresponds to. It also has material on the kanji, but it's entirely up to you whether you want to study the kanji right after the kana or put them off for later (I expect most people will prefer to put them off for a while).</p>

<p>After that, you need to get a dictionary, some kind of source material, and a translation for it. First-timers should try using the source material dissections included in this guide, though I don't know how long those will last you. The meat of the guide is composed of these four sections: <a class="underscore" href="#Particles">Particles</a>, <a class="underscore" href="#Vocabulary">Vocabulary</a>, <a class="underscore" href="#Conjugation">Conjugation</a> and <a class="underscore" href="#Clauses">Clauses</a>. Start by reading as much of the first section as you can digest in one sitting, then look for the stuff it talked about in your chosen source material.</p>

<p>Intially, this means looking for particles in random sentences and figuring out how they're being used. You will not be able to understand the vast majority of the text, but that's fine. Just look up some of the words in the simpler sentences, try to identify the particles around them, guess what they're doing, and compare against the translation to see how much you got right.</p>

<p>The idea is that after a while, you get a feel for basic particles, so then you can move on to reading material further in the guide, then trying to apply those new ideas to the source material again. After a few weeks, you should be starting to look at common pronouns and transition words. After a few months, you should be looking primarily at verb forms. After several months, you should have very little trouble with simple sentences and be focusing your efforts on ones with multiple clauses. This process is definitely slow at first, but over time you'll be amazed at how much your fluency accelerates.</p>

<p>Moreover, if you ever want to learn any language, you will have to do something like this eventually. There's no way around that. However, there are a lot of resources you can use to get a "headstart" on grasping certain aspects of the language. For instance, Rosetta Stone is a good headstart for understanding the particles (and some basic vocabulary), and Heisig's Remembering the Kanji is a good headstart for mnemonically memorizing kanji shapes and meanings. Using stuff like this can be a very good idea, as long as you're aware that they are only headstarts and should never be treated as authoritative references or teaching methods (in particular, anyone who thinks that you can use RtK to "learn all the kanji" is deluded).</p>

<p>The other sections in the guide are all some kind of supplement with no particular order or structure, and it really doesn't matter when you read them or what you do with them. But do check them out at some point.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<h4 id="Source Material">Source Material</h4>

<p>"Source material" is a term I use to refer to anything created in a given language, by a native speaker of that language, and intended for use by other native speakers of that language.  Depending on your location, budget, and attitudes towards legality, you may wish to travel to a Japantown and buy something in person, mail order something online, or download/pirate stuff from the internet.  This guide and I will always assume you are attempting to read Japanese source material on a regular basis (regardless of how much of it you can actually understand).  Important things to keep in mind when choosing your first source material (that isn't part of this guide):</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">&#8226; it must have furigana (tiny kana written above every kanji)</li>
<li class="tod">&#8226; you must have a good translation of the material to compare against</li>
<li class="tod">&#8226; in general, dramas or plot-driven stories are significantly easier to learn from than romance or character-driven stories (since they use more abstract words), and vastly easier to learn from than comedy (which requires instant comprehension to be funny)</li>
<li class="tod">&#8226; avoid anything likely to use heavy slang, thick accents, classical language, etc.</li>
<li class="tod">&#8226; above all else, you should enjoy reading the translated version</li>
</ul>

<p>For most people I know, the ideal first source material will be a manga series serialized in the Shonen Jump magazine.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<h4 id="Introduction to the Three Japanese Alphabets">Introduction to the Three Japanese Alphabets</h4>

<p>One of the most unique aspects of the Japanese language is that it can use up to three different alphabets at the same time.  I think it's worth giving you at least a skeletal understanding of the way they interact before making you seriously study them.</p>

<p>The three Japanese alphabets are called hiragana, katakana and kanji.  The kana (hiragana and katakana together) are phonograms, just like the English alphabet.  The kanji are ideograms, and are in many ways analogous to Greek and Latin roots in English.</p>

<p>There are 71 hiragana, 71 katakana, and between 2,000 and 50,000 kanji depending on who you ask.  Hiragana and katakana have a perfect one-to-one relationship (i.e., every hiragana has one corresponding katakana which represents the same sound, and vice versa).  Hiragana are used constantly, so they will be your first priority. Katakana are used primarily for loanwords and miscellaneous aesthetic purposes, so they're less common.  Kanji are used most of the time, although technically they're always optional, so conventions on whether to write a word in kanji or hiragana vary significantly.  Also, there are several words which have no kanji.</p>

<p>Most words are written one of three ways: kana only, kanji only, or kanji followed by hiragana.  In the third case, the hiragana that follow are called okurigana.  Kanji, as ideograms, tend to embody the meaning of a word, while the exact word being used may be specified and then inflected using okurigana.</p>

<p>Here are two short sample sentences:</p>

<table class="conjugation">

<li class="tod">Sentences: 深く考えないで下さい</li>
<li class="tod">Romaji: fukaku kangaenaidekudasai.</li>
<li class="tod">Translation: Please don't think deeply about them.</li>
</ul>

<p>The words written only in hiragana here are pretty easy.  この means "this/these," and です is a polite way of ending a sentence. The katakana word サンプル is a simple loanword, exactly as easy as the romaji make it look.  The first kanji here—文—is representing the word "bun (sentence)" by itself.  When you're more familiar with common particles (see document 2b), it will be naturally obvious to you that the letter は is a particle (marking the subject of the sentence) rather than okurigana, and thus that  文 is meant to be read alone.  The second kanji—深—is the beginning of the word 深い fukai (deep). The いi has been changed to くku to indicate a change from adjective to adverb.  Again, once you're more familiar with this sort of thing, it will be naturally obvious that the く is okurigana for 深.  The third kanji—考—is the beginning of the word 考える kangaeru (to think), which has been heavily conjugated.  The ない indicates a negative form ("don't"), the で indicates a connective form allowing more to be added, and the 下さい is an additional form meaning "please."   Notice that it also starts with a kanji but has a few okurigana.</p>

<p>Hopefully this now makes at least some vague conceptual sense.</p>

<p>This section contains information about the kana (Japanese phonetic alphabets) and kanji (the Japanese ideograms), as well as a little bit about pronunciation, typing, romanization, punctuation, and honorifics.  Though it's largely up to you when you start studying kanji, everything else in this section you should know before learning any grammar. In particular, you should know all the kana by heart.  The rest of the guide will assume you can read kana (and look up kanji) on your own.</p>

<h4 id="Pronunciation">Pronunciation</h4>

<p>Compared to any European language, the pronunciation rules of Japanese are almost unbelievably simple, in that there is almost zero ambiguity.  The basic difference between English and Romaji pronunciation is the vowels.  If you happen to know Spanish, you're in luck, because that language uses the exact same vowel pronunciation.  If you don't, here's the short version:</p>

<p>English has at least a short and long sound for each, while Japanese only has one sound.  The letter "a" can be "ah" or "ay" in English, but only "ah" in Japanese.  "e" can be "eh" or "ee" in English, only "eh" in Japanese.  "i" can be "ih" or "ee" or "ai" in English, only "ee" in Japanese.  "o" can be "ah" or "uh" or "oo" in English, only "oo" in Japanese.  Finally, "u" can be "uh" or "uu" in English, only "uu" in Japanese.</p>

<p>Here's another attempt at explaining it:</p>

<table class="conjugation">
<tr><th>Japanese</th><th>Unique to English</th></tr>
<tr><td>"a" as in "<em>a</em>ttic"</td><td>"a" as in "<em>a</em>te"</td></tr>
<tr><td>"e" as in "<em>e</em>dible"</td><td>"e" as in "Japan<em>e</em>se"</td></tr>
<tr><td>"i" like the "ee" in "f<em>ee</em>t"</td><td>"i" as in "<em>i</em>gloo"</td></tr>
<tr><td>"o" as in "<em>o</em>pen"</td><td>"o" as in "<em>o</em>ctopus"</td></tr>
<tr><td>"u" like the "oo" in "b<em>oo</em>t"</td><td>"u" as in "<em>u</em>p"</td></tr>
</table>

<p>And another:</p>

<table class="conjugation">
<tr><th>Romaji</th><th>(Rough) Pronunciation</th></tr>
<tr><td>kokoro ga yureugoku tabi</td><td>koh-koh-roh gah you-reh-uu-go-kuu tah-bee</td></tr>
<tr><td>machi mo hito mo kotoba mo</td><td>mah-chee moh hee-toh moh koh-toh-bah moh</td></tr>
<tr><td>chigau iro ni naru</td><td>chee-gah-uu ee-roh nii nah-ruu</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Hopefully that makes it pretty clear.  The only time this gets any harder is with the vowel blends, but even those are pretty easy to sound out.  Consider "ai" for instance.  Try sounding it out: "ah-ee," and then say it faster and faster.  It should start to sound just like the English pronoun "I."  All other blends are just as easy.  If you can't figure out what two vowels would sound like together, then they probably don't make a blend and you should pronounce them separately.</p>

<p>The only other things that confuse Westerners are letters like "tsu," but that's also pronounced exactly as it sounds.  Try to convince yourself that the "t" in "tsunami" isn't actually silent and it shouldn't take too long.  "dzu" and "dji" are weirder but also not hard once you see them get used a few times (especially since nowadays they're usually pronounced exactly the same as "zu" and "ji").</p>

<p>The pairs of short lines above four of the last five rows are called 濁り nigori.  The circles above the last row are called 丸 maru.  Every letter with a nigori or maru is a variant on one that has neither, so it is suggested you memorize these letters in doubles and triples like かが and はばぱ whenever possible.  Not counting variants, there are 55 hiragana.</p>

<p>A glide is a special combination of two kana whose sounds can blend together. All glides require the second letter to be written smaller than usual; if it isn't small pronounce them as two separate letters.</p>

<p>For example, 「きゃ」 is "kya" but 「きや」 is "kiya"</p>

<table class="conjugation">
<tr><td>きゃ kya</td><td>きゅ kyu</td><td>きょ kyo</td></tr>
<tr><td>しゃ sha</td><td>しゅ shu</td><td>しょ sho</td></tr>
<tr><td>ちゃ cha</td><td>ちゅ chu</td><td>ちょ cho</td></tr>
<tr><td>にゃ nya</td><td>にゅ nyu</td><td>にょ nyo</td></tr>
<tr><td>ひゃ hya</td><td>ひゅ hyu</td><td>ひょ hyo</td></tr>
<tr><td>みゃ mya</td><td>みゅ myu</td><td>みょ myo</td></tr>
<tr><td>りゃ rya</td><td>りゅ ryu</td><td>りょ ryo</td></tr>
<tr><td>ぎゃ gya</td><td>ぎゅ gyu</td><td>ぎょ gyo</td></tr>

<tr><td>びゃ bya</td><td>びゅ byu</td><td>びょ byo</td></tr>
<tr><td>ぴゃ pya</td><td>ぴゅ pyu</td><td>ぴょ pyo</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Also, a っ or "little つ" always means that the following letter has a double consonant. </p>

<p>For example: きっぷ kippu,　けっこう kekkou,　やった yatta</p>

<p>Note that the glides にゃ, にゅ and にょ can be easily confused with the non-glides んや, んゆ and んよ when romanized.  For this reason the latter trio should be romanized with an apostrophe after the "n" to indicate the syllable break. To clarify:</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">にゃ nya ≠ んや</li>
<li class="tod">にゅ nyu ≠ んゆ n'yu</li>
<li class="tod">にょ nyo ≠ んよ n'yo</li>
</ul>

<p>For example: けんいち = Ken'ichi, not Keni-chi or Ke-nichi</p>

<h4 id="Typing in Japanese">Typing in Japanese</h4>

<p>If you can’t type in Japanese yet, add Japanese to your keyboard languages now and get used to the IME (Input Method Editor) right away.  If you don't know how, explore the Language settings in your control panel, or use google to find a thorough tutorial for your OS.</p>

<p>Once you've switched to Japanese input, first you simply type the romaji for each kana (i.e. type "ka" and か appears, type "mya" and みゃ appears).  As you type, notice there is a dotted line underneath the kana.  This means they haven't actually been entered yet because you may want to convert them to kanji.  Press the space bar to make the IME guess what kanji you want.  It will then split the string into several segments, convert them to kanji, and underline the farthest left segment.  Press the space bar again to see a menu with other conversion options for this segment.  Use the arrow keys to scroll through these menus or change which segment you want to see the menu for.  Pressing enter at any time during this process (even before pressing space the first time) will remove all underlining and actually enter the string in whatever form it currently appears.</p>

<p>The details of conversion you can and should work out yourself by experimenting, or by googling for more thorough tutorials.  However, there are some important exceptions to the "just type the romaji" rule, as follows:</p>

<p>To type a small hiragana or katakana outside a glide, either use the conversion menus (the long way), or type "l" or "x" in front of it.  For example: typing "ya" makes や while typing "lya" or "xya" makes ゃ.  The same trick allows you to type やよゆあえいおう as ゃょゅぁぇぃぉぅ for assorted aesthetic reasons, though it won't work on any of the other hiragana.</p>

<p>The following letters/blends are typed differently from how they are pronounced.  These are mostly the result of non-Hepburn romanization systems, as explained below.</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">"tu" and "tsu" both make 「つ tsu」</li>
<li class="tod">"du" makes 「づ dzu」</li>
<li class="tod">"di" makes 「ぢ dji」</li>
<li class="tod">"dya" makes 「ぢゃ dja」</li>
<li class="tod">"dyu" makes 「ぢゅ dju」</li>
<li class="tod">"dyo" makes 「ぢょ djo」</li>
<li class="tod">"n' " makes 「ん n」</li>
<li class="tod">"nn" makes 「ん n」</li>
</ul>

<p>Typing 「ん n」 can be particularly annoying because typing any consonant or punctuation mark after it will cause it to convert to ん even if you did not type "n" twice.  This makes it easy to get in the habit of typing "n" once, which usually results in problems like typing にゃ when you meant んや, or having words end with ｎ for no apparent reason.  The ideal habit is to always type "nn" for ん just to be safe.</p>

<p>A loanword, if you don't already know, is a word in one language that speakers of another language borrow and start using themselves, to the point where it becomes part of their language as well, often with a different meaning from the original.</p>

<p>When using katakana to write a loanword which—in the original language—ends in a consonant, the letters "ku," "su," "ru," "to," "fu," and their variants (gu, zu, do, bu, pu) will often have their vowels dropped without any extra indication.</p>

<p>All the hiragana glides work the same in katakana, with the following additions:</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">キャ kya now also means ca (like in "cat")</li>
<li class="tod">ファ fa フェ fe フィ fi フォ fo</li>
<li class="tod">ウィ wi ウェ we ディ di</li>
<li class="tod">ヴァ va ヴェ ve ヴィ vi ヴォ vo (the kana ヴ for "v" is a very recent invention, so a "b" letter will just as often be used to imitate the "v" sound)</li>
</ul>

<p>The chouon (dash) is a shortening of the term 長音符 (ちょうおんぷ) chouonpu, literally meaning "long sound mark."  It is used like this:</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">アー er/ar/or (also applies to all other letters with an "a" sound)</li>
<li class="tod">オー o (specifies a long "o," also applies to all other letters with an "o" sound)</li>
<li class="tod">シー shii (specifies a long "I," also applies to all other letters with an "i" sound)</li>
</ul>

<p>These symbols can be used to stand for sounds that Japanese doesn't use.  When speaking Japanese, stick to the pronunciation these letters would normally represent even if they are being used to imitate English words.</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">シ shi ("see"; like in "season")</li>
<li class="tod">ス su (hard "th"; as in "health")</li>
<li class="tod">ザ za (soft "th"; as in "the")</li>
<li class="tod">ン n ("m"; only if followed by another consonant)</li>
<li class="tod">ツ tsu ("tu"; like in "two")</li>
</ul>

<p>These two symbols are also very common in loanwords and foreign names:</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">・ (represents where a space would have been placed in English; typed with the / key)</li>
<li class="tod">＝ (used when a given name is written before a surname)</li>
</ul>

<p>Since loanwords are almost always written in katakana, here are some random examples to help clarify the rules from part 2. Many of the rules listed above affect pronunciation but not romanization, so the romaji here may not reflect them.</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">システム shisutemu (system)</li>
<li class="tod">レベル reberu (level)</li>
<li class="tod">ビデオ bideo (video)</li>

<h4 id="Romanization">Romanization</h4>

<p>Romanization means taking a language not written in the Roman alphabet, and somehow writing it in the Roman alphabet.</p>

<p>I use something close to Hepburn style for all of this guide, because that's the system designed to actually look like the correct sounds to native English speakers.  That's also the style you saw above in the kana charts. The other popular systems, Kunrei-shiki and Nihon-shiki, were made by and for Japanese speakers.</p>

<p>Things distinctive of non-Hepburn styles include romanizing つづしふじ as tu, du, si, hu, zi, and writing all glides with a "y" in the middle (e.g. じゃ as "zya" instead of"ja")  Although sometimes ふ should in fact be read as "hu", most of those spellings are simply misleading to any Westerner trying to learn the language. You need to be aware of them simply to avoid being confused when you do see them, because they do get used a lot (especially in Japan).</p>

<p>Even within Hepburn, there are tons of variations and controversy.  Most notably, my usage of dzu/dji for づぢ is technically obsolete, but I'm convinced it's useful, if only because using the same romanization for two distinct kana (zu for both ずづ or ji for both じぢ) is just asking for confusion.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<h4 id="Punctuation">Punctuation</h4>

<p>In Japanese, punctuation (including spaces) is entirely optional, so usage is a bit more inconsistent than in English, but a lot of it is basically the same.  Just don't rely on it to tell you when clauses and sentences end as much as you would in English.</p>

<p>The marks to know are the period (。), the comma (、), the square brackets (「」) which act as quotation marks, and the hollow square brackets (『』) whose exact meaning are entirely up to the author.  Also notice that the characters themselves have a lot of blank white space, so even if it looks like Japanese text has spaces after its commas or periods, it really doesn't.  The reason for this filler is that every single character in Japanese is meant to fit within a square.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<h4 id="Honorifics">Honorifics</h4>

<p>In English, our honorifics include the prefixes Mr., Ms., Miss, Sir, Ma'am and occupational titles like President or Supervisor.  While occupational titles can always be looked up and often translated literally, the most common of the general purpose Japanese ones need to be explained.  Also, all Japanese honorifics are suffixes.</p>

<table class="conjugation">
<tr><td>-[blank]:</td><td>unlike English, simply not using an honorific (when addressing someone directly, doesn't matter in the third person) implies a very close relationship</td></tr>
<tr><td>さん -san:</td><td>the default honorific for just about anyone, regardless of age or occupation</td></tr>
<tr><td>君  -kun:</td><td>a more friendly honorific, usually used for males of the same age or lower</td></tr>
<tr><td>ちゃん -chan:</td><td>a friendly and cute honorific, usually used for young females</td></tr>
<tr><td>様 -sama:</td><td>a respectful honorific used for those of a higher social standing</td></tr>
<tr><td>殿 -dono:</td><td>even more respectful than -sama, less likely to be used solely out of obligation</td></tr>
</table>

<p>These last three have English equivalents, but are so incredibly common that they often can't be translated literally (or at all) without sounding far stiffer than they should.</p>

<table class="conjugation">
<tr><td>先生 -sensei:</td><td>usually "teacher" or "doctor," also any professional the speaker respects</td></tr>
<tr><td>先輩 -senpai:</td><td>"upperclassman," someone with more experience or in a higher grade level</td></tr>

</table>

<p>At this point you've read everything you need to know before moving on to <a class="underscore" href="#Particles">Particles</a>. I would recommend skimming the kanji information below so that you're not completely unaware of it, but you don't have to seriously study the kanji for quite some time (since you can get source material with furigana).</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<h4 id="Kanji">Kanji</h4>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="Kanji Introduction">Kanji Introduction</div>

<p>漢字 kanji are ideograms.  In other words, they represent ideas.  Not sounds, not words, but ideas.  That's the number one thing I want you to get out of studying them.  Often, they are also combinations of other ideograms, which allows you to pull them apart and come up with some kind of rational explanation for these arbitrary shapes.  The simplest elements a kanji can be broken into what I call <strong>primitives</strong>.  Traditionally, the Chinese organize their hanzi and the Japanese their kanji using a standardized list of 214 primitives (and their common variants) called <strong>radicals</strong>.  If you have a dictionary that lets you look up kanji using their radicals (and you should before you study the kanji) then you can use it to look up each radical's meaning on your own.</p>

<p>A quick warning: don't ever rely on lists of kanji to tell you what you should learn. That's just as silly and counterproductive as thinking that there can be a list of a couple thousand English words you need to know to use the language, and nothing else. Lists can certaintly be good starting points, but never treat them as anything more than that. The majority of your kanji knowledge will come from reading actual source material, especially when it comes to things like knowing which reading or meaning to use in which compounds.</p>

<p>As implied earlier, if you can recognize what all of the radicals and small kanji in a really messy kanji mean, sometimes you can guess what the entire kanji means just from that.  Most of the time, you can't.  The reason studying radicals is useful is that once you know them, you look up a kanji, then come up with a way of associating the meanings of the radicals with the meaning of the kanji as a whole, often in the form of some amusing nonsense sentence or pithy statement.  Once you start doing that, remembering what complex kanji mean and look like gets far easier.  A few quick examples:</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">魔（ま）demon/magic</li>
<li class="tod">Elements: 53广cave, 林（はやし）forest, 194鬼（おに）demon</li>
<li class="tod"><strong>Demons</strong> and <em>magical</em> creatures live in a <strong>cave</strong> hidden inside a <strong>forest</strong> that nobody dares to enter.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">神（かみ）god</li>
<li class="tod">Elements: 113c礻altar, 102d申 speak</li>
<li class="tod">Priests <strong>speak</strong> to <em>god</em> at the <strong>altar</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">騎（き）horse riding</li>
<li class="tod">Elements: 馬（うま）horse, 奇（くしき）strange</li>
<li class="tod">A wild <strong>horse</strong> would find <em>horse riding</em> to be quite <strong>strange</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>If that looked utterly arbitrary, it was.  There is no general method of determining a kanji's meaning from its elements, so the idea here is simply to recognize kanji inside other kanji, and some really common radicals with meanings everyone agrees on, so that you can invent these mnemonics and save yourself a lot of time and effort. Of course, for this to work, you have to memorize several dozen simple kanji first.  Once you've done that, take a look at the radicals list below and start looking for them the next time you try to read something in Japanese.</p>

<p>Finally, a brief touch on stroke counts/order.  If you want to see the strokes for any kanji, visit http://kakijun.main.jp/main/kensaku.htmland type it in.  You don't need to know anything about strokes to simply read kanji, but since radical-based dictionaries rely on stroke count to organize entries, and you have to know strokes in order to write any kanji by hand well, it's still good to know.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="List of Radicals">List of Radicals</div>

<p>Format is: radical number, stroke count in (), the radical itself (may be shown indirectly inside {}s), and meaning.  If the radical can only appear on a certain part of a kanji, it's mentioned inside []s.</p>

<p>Most of these meanings are widely agreed upon, and all of them should be useful, but feel free to ignore or disagree with some of them since these are in no way hard rules.  And of course, you do not have to memorize all of these anytime soon.</p>

<div class="guideheading" id="Kanji Readings">Kanji Readings</div>

<p>Now the important part.  Just about every single kanji has at least two readings, or ways it can be pronounced.  Most of these readings are either 音読み on'yomi or 訓読み kun'yomi, and it's safe to assume every kanji you will ever encounter has at least one of each.  While there is no strict way of distinguishing the two categories, a lot of useful rules of thumb can be stated.</p>

<ul class="tod">Kun'yomi are...
<li class="tod">・words by themselves</li>
<li class="tod">・written with the kanji and some extra hiragana called okurigana</li>
<li class="tod">・often verbs (the kanji is the stem) or -i adjectives</li>
<li class="tod">・added to the characters by the Japanese</li>
<li class="tod">・usually unique to a single kanji or a small set of kanji with similar meanings</li>
</ul>

<ul class="tod">On'yomi are...
<li class="tod">・words only when combined with other kanji</li>
<li class="tod">・written without any okurigana (the only one of these statements with no exceptions)</li>
<li class="tod">・often nouns or -na adjectives</li>
<li class="tod">・based on Chinese readings of the same characters</li>
<li class="tod">・usually shared by several kanji</li>
</ul>

<p>As an example, let's consider the very typical kanji 走.  Its readings are:</p>
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">1) the kun'yomi はしる, a verb meaning "to run" with okurigana る</li>
<li class="tod">2) the on'yomi ソウ meaning "run," used in compounds like 疾走 sprint and 走者 runner</li>
</ul>

<p>And in contrast, a potentially annoying one, 間:</p>
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">1) the kun'yomi あいだ, a noun meaning "space/interval"</li>
<li class="tod">2) the kun'yomi ま, a noun meaning "space/room" or "time/pause," used in many idiomatic phrases</li>
<li class="tod">3) the on'yomi カン meaning "period of time," "space" or "between," used in numerous compounds</li>
<li class="tod">4) the on'yomi ケン meaning a figurative "space," used in the compound 世間 society</li>
</ul>

<p>You may be wondering in cases like 間 how to tell which kun'yomi or which on'yomi to use.  The short answer is there is no way other than memorizing all the words they're used in.  The long answer is that once you've seen the kanji used for a while, you'll get a feel for when one reading or the other gets used more often, or know that this reading is only used in a handful of compounds or this reading is never used on its own, etc.  But remember this is strictly on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>Note that both of those example kanji are a bit lacking in usage examples.  It's mostly up to you to study and pay enough attention to the kanji that you can eventually remember most of their readings, what they mean and what words they're used in.  Also, if you want to see how messy it can get, try looking up 生 or 下.</p>

<p>You may recall I said "most" (not "all") readings are either kun'yomi or on'yomi.  The third category I was implying is 名乗り nanori, or name readings.  Just as the term implies, these are readings which only get used in people's names.  Many of these are so strange and irregular that entire dictionaries exist for nothing but nanori. However, since they're never used outside of names, you can safely ignore them for now and focus on learning real words instead.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="Reading Changes in Compounds">Reading Changes in Compounds</div>

<p>When making compounds, some kanji can change their reading a bit.  There are three (arguably just two) ways this can happen.  To simplify the explanations below, pretend we're talking only about compounds of two kanji or two words.</p>

<p>1) If the last syllable of the first kanji is つ or less often く, it may change toっ</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">絶（ぜつ）beyond words ＋ 対（たい）versus ＝ 絶対（ぜったい）surely, absolutely</li>
<li class="tod">結（けつ）bind together ＋ 果（か）fruit, reward ＝ 結果（けっか）consequence, result, effect</li>
<li class="tod">抹（まつ）erase, rub away ＋ 殺（さつ）kill ＝ 抹殺（まっさつ）obliteration, denial</li>
<li class="tod">錯（さく）mix, disorder ＋ 覚（かく）remember ＝ 錯覚（さっかく）hallucination, optical illusion</li>
</ul>

<p>2) If the first syllable of the second kanji is a kana which could have nigori added to it, then those nigori might be added.  Same for marus.</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">死（しに）death＋神（かみ）god＝死神（しにがみ）shinigami, death god</li>
<li class="tod">番（ばん）a round, a shift, a number＋組（くみ）take part in＝番組（ばんぐみ）TV program</li>
<li class="tod">出（で）go out＋口（くち）mouth, passageway＝出口（でぐち）exit</li>
</ul>

<p>3) Arguably not an actual change, but when the last syllable of the first kanji is ん and the first consonant sound of the second kanji is "m," "b" or "p," the ん might be pronounced more like an "m" than an "n."</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">簡（かん）brevity＋明（めい）clarity＝簡明（かんめいkammei）conciseness</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dotted">

<p>In English, you generally rely on word order to determine what each word is doing in the sentence.  In Japanese, while there are rules for word order, only a handful of verb-related rules are actually mandatory (they're explained in <a class="underscore" href="#Clauses">Clauses</a>).  The optional rules can be summed up by the fact that Japanese sentences default to SOV (subject, object, verb) order. English enforces an SVO (subject, verb, object) order on all of its sentences. For instance, in English we say "I bought flowers", but in Japanese you would normally put "flowers" in front of "bought", though other arrangements are also valid.</p>

<p>Instead of word order, Japanese relies on its particles to tell you what each word is doing.  It is impossible to define these particles in terms of any single English word or concept, so I need to use some basic grammatical terms to explain them. If you aren't confident you know what terms like "subject", "object", "inflection", "conjugation", "stem", "tense" and of course "particle" mean, go read the <a class="underscore" href="#Terminology">Terminology</a> section now.</p>

<p>I divide Japanese particles into four categories: simple case markers, sentence ending particles, compound particles, and grammatical vocabulary.  That last category is made up of words which may or may not be considered particles, so I'm saving it for the next section.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<h4 id="Simple Case Markers">Simple Case Markers</h4>

<p>"case marker" is the term for a word that denotes the grammatical role of another word (in Japanese they are all postpositions, meaning they denote the role of the previous word or phrase).  Case markers are the core of all Japanese grammar, and you should spend the vast majority of your time trying to master them.  As a result, I'll cover each one individually, after quickly showing you a list with all of them.</p>

<p>When explaining them individually, I will use example sentences simple enough that you should be able to work them out just by looking up some words and reading what I wrote around them. However, I will also omit some details and even entire meanings which neither can nor should be explained at this stage, instead leaving links to places in the guide where they are explained.</p>

<p><strong>List of Simple Case Markers:</strong></p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">は (wa) indicates the subject, or the context</li>
<li class="tod">が indicates the subject, the object in certain cases, or just means "but"</li>
<li class="tod">も indicates a subject and implies the existence of another subject</li>
<li class="tod">を (o) indicates an object</li>
<li class="tod">と can mean "and," "with," "if," or mark any object which can be interpreted as a quotation</li>
<li class="tod">の indicates possession, means "of" (except backwards), or links adjectives to nouns</li>
<li class="tod">へ (e) indicates the goal, destination or direction of an action</li>
<li class="tod">で indicates either the means by which or the situation in which an action is performed</li>
<li class="tod">な marks an adjective or changes a noun into an adjective</li>
<li class="tod">に changes a noun to an adverb, or indicates location, or indicates an animate or optional object</li>
<li class="tod">って indicates a quotation, or informally a subject/context</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="は wa">は wa</div>

<p>は is normally pronounced "ha", but it changes to "wa" when used as a particle. Don't worry, it's the only kana that ever does this.</p>

<p>1) denotes the subject of the clause</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">This should be easy to understand even if it's hard to get used to. To say it a bit more intuitively: は wa comes immediately after whatever is performing the action.</li>
<li class="tod">学校は楽しい	School is fun.</li>
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">学校　"School" is the subject</li>
</ul>
<li class="tod">馬は跳んだ　The horse jumped.</li>
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">馬　"The horse" is the subject</li>
</ul>
<li class="tod">If you tried to learn Japanese through watching anime, you may have convinced yourself that は means "is". It does not. In fact the first sentence has no verb at all, which is perfectly fine in Japanese.</li>
</ul>

<p>2) denotes the context in which the main clause occurs</p>
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">This sounds odd at first, but it's surprisingly easy to understand in examples.</li>
<li class="tod">昨日はみんなが欠席だった　Yesterday, everyone was absent.</li>
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">昨日 "Yesterday" is the context within which "everyone was absent".</li>
</ul>
<li class="tod">俺は蛇が怖い　For me, snakes are scary.</li>
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">俺　"me" is the context within which "snakes are scary".</li>
</ul>
<li class="tod">With simple sentences like this, it's possible to treat these as special cases and not as a true alternate meaning of は wa. But there are more complex sentences where you need to see this as a genuine alternate meaning.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="が ga">が ga</div>

<p>1) denotes the subject</p>

<p>This meaning is shared with は wa. Usually, when denoting a subject, は wa and が ga are technically interchangeable.</p>
 
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">学校が楽しい　School is fun.</li>
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">学校　"School" is the subject</li>
</ul>
<li class="tod">馬が跳んだ　The horse jumped.</li>
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">馬　"The horse" is the subject</li>
</ul>	
</ul>

<p>A lot of the time either は wa or が ga will be a more natural choice (either due to convention or to prevent <a class="underscore" href="#Ambiguity%20and%20Context">clause break ambiguity</a>), but that is not something you should be worrying about at this stage. It's much better to learn it through experience anyway.</p>

<p>2) can denote an object if it is inanimate or the object of an emotion</p>

<p>This is much more likely to be an issue with simple sentences, but it's also a lot less common than the first meaning, so don't worry too much about it.</p>

 
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">成績がもらった　I received my grades.</li>
<li class="tod">野菜が嫌い　I hate vegetables.</li>
</ul>

<p>My theory is, が ga can denote an object if either: the object is inanimate and thus incapable of performing the action in question (grades can't receive, vegetables can't hate), or it's the object of an emotion. The latter is a genuinely special case, since it seems to apply to only a small handful of emotional words like 好き suki (like/love), 嫌い kirai (dislike/hate), 怖い kowai (afraid), which already have some <a class="underscore" href="#Words%20with%20odd%20grammatical%20behavior">odd grammatical behavior</a>, so don't let this worry you.</p>

 <p>3) can simply mean "but"</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">宿題はいいが、テストが難しすぎる　The homework is fine, but the tests are too hard.</li>
</ul>
 
<p>4) used to make a certain conditional verb form</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">Will be explained <a class="underscore" href="#Conjugation">later</a>.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="も mo">も mo</div>

<p>1) denotes one of multiple subjects (the others may be implied)</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">学校も楽しい　School is also fun.</li>
<li class="tod">馬も跳んだ　The horse also jumped.</li>
<li class="tod">This should be pretty easy.</li>
</ul>

<p>2) changes interrogative pronouns into indefinite or negative pronouns</p>
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">Virtually every case of this is listed somewhere later in the guide, such as <a class="underscore" href="#Pronouns%20and%20Closely%20Related%20Words">List of Pronouns</a> or <a class="underscore" href="#-te%20Forms">-te Forms</a>, so you don't have to worry about it.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="を wo">を wo</div>

<p>を wo is often pronounced closer to "o" than "wo", and may be romanized as just "o", though I don't consider this a serious pronunciation change.</p>

<p>1) denotes the object of the clause</p>

<p>This should also be easy to understand: を wo comes immediately after whatever is being acted upon.</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">リスが栗を拾った　The squirrel picked up a chestnut.</li>
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">栗 "a chestnut" is the object</li>
</ul>
<li class="tod">私は帽子を被る　I'll wear a hat.</li>
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">帽子 "a hat" is the object</li>
</ul>
</ul>	

<p>Since this particle has no other meanings or uses, it should be one of the easiest to learn. On the other hand, several other particles are capable of denoting objects, so don't get complacent with this one.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="と to">と to</div>

<p>1) denotes an object which can be interpreted as a quote, often before a verb such as 言う (say) or 思う (think)</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">俺は一ヶ月が必要と思う　I think one month is needed. / I think that "One month is needed".</li>
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">The quote/thought "One month is needed" is the object.</li>
</ul>
<li class="tod">彼女がはいと言ったか？　Did she say yes? / Did she say "yes"?</li>
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">The quote "yes" is the object.</li>
</ul>
</ul>	

<p>Basically, there's a handful of verbs that love to use と to for denoting their objects instead of を wo, and about a year ago it finally hit me that objects for those verbs can almost always be interpreted as quotations. This includes onomatopoeias, which Japanese has loads of.</p>

<p>2) denotes one of multiple subjects that performed a single action together; often means "with"</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">あいつと勝負した　I fought with him.</li>
<li class="tod">みんなと行きました　I went with everyone.</li>
</ul>

<p>3) simply means "if" or "when" after verbs</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">終わると、夜明けでした　When I finished, it was dawn.</li>
<li class="tod">今行くと死ぬぞ　If you go now you'll die.</li>
</ul>

<p>4) can simply mean "and" between two short nouns or adjectives</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">彼女と私は協力しています　She and I are working together.</li>
<li class="tod">教科書とノートを持ってきた　I brought my textbook and notebook.</li>
</ul>

<p>5) used to make a certain negative conditional verb form</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">Will be explained <a class="underscore" href="#Negative%20and%20Polite%20Forms">later</a>.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="の no">の no</div>

<p>1) means "of," except backward compared to English, and is used more broadly</p>

 
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">これは愛の物語　This is a story of love.</li>
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">"愛 (love) の 物語 (story)" becomes "story of love"</li>
</ul>
<li class="tod">赤のチームは負けた　The team of red lost. or The red team lost.</li>
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">"赤 (red) の チーム (team)" becomes "team of red" or "red team"</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>This is another one of those things that's easy to understand but hard to get used to. By "more broadly", I meant that の no is used even in sentences like the second example where the use of "of" is considered incorrect in English.</p>

<p>2) denotes possession</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">近所のガーデンは森だ　The neighbor's garden is a forest.</li>
<li class="tod">"近所 (neighbor) の" becomes "neighbor's"</li>
</ul>
<li class="tod">俺のコンピューターは早い　My computer is fast.</li>
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">"俺 (I/me) の" becomes "my"</li>
</ul>	
</ul>

<p>This is even easier than in English, since you don't have to memorize a set of possessive pronouns like "my", "his", "her", and "theirs". Arguably this is a special case of the first meaning ("garden of neighbor" becomes "neighbor's garden", "computer of me" becomes "my computer").</p>

<p>3) in compound particles, may be short for a clause-ending noun</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">Will be explained <a class="underscore" href="#Compound%20Particles">later</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>4) connects nouns to adjectives in a noun phrase used as an interjection</p>

<p>This is a special case you shouldn't spend much time on. In English, it's common to exclaim things like "You idiot!" or "That bastard!", even though those are neither sentences nor interjections. Specifically, noun phrases can be used like interjections. You can do exactly the same things in Japanese, as long as you put の no in between: "君のバカ！" or "あいつの野郎！"</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="へ he">へ he</div>

<p>へ he is often pronounced closer to "e" than "he", and may be romanized as just "e", though I don't consider this a serious pronunciation change.</p>

<p>1) denotes a direction or destination of literal or figurative travel</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">東へ行きます　I'll go east.</li>
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">"東 (east)" is the literal direction</li>
</ul>
<li class="tod">熟達へ近づいてる　I'm approaching mastery.</li>
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">"熟達 (mastery)" is the figurative destination</li>
</ul>	
</ul>	
 
<p>Also pretty easy, although the compound particles using へ he are so similar in meaning that they often get used more than へ he itself.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="で de">で de</div>

<p>1) denotes the situation in which the action is performed</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">家で眠りたい　I want to sleep at home.</li>
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">"家 (home)" is the situation in which "sleeping" is performed</li>
</ul>
<li class="tod">放課後で話した　We talked after school.</li>
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">"放課後 (after school)" is the situation in which "talking" is performed</li>
</ul>	
</ul>	

<p>This use of で de often corresponds to English prepositions such as "at" and "during".</p>

<p>2) denotes the means by which the action is performed</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">鉛筆で書く　I'll write it in pencil.</li>
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">"鉛筆 (pencil)" is the means by which "writing" is performed</li>
</ul>
<li class="tod">人形で遊びたくない　I don't want to play with dolls.</li>
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">"人形 (dolls)" are the means by which "playing" is preformed</li>
</ul>
</ul>	

<p>This use of で de often corresponds to English prepositions such as "with" and "in".</p>
<p>Notice that the use of "with" I'm referring to here is distinct from the use of "with" that と can correspond to.</p>

<p>3) can simply be a transition, meaning "so" (causal) or "then" (temporal)</p>

<p>Also pretty easy, although the compound particles using で de are so similar in meaning that they often get used more than で de itself (for this meaning at least).</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="な na">な na</div>

<p>1) denotes an adjective</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">素敵な歌だわ　It's a wonderful song.</li>
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">"素敵 (wonderful)" is the adjective</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>2) together with 的 (てき), can transform any noun into an adjective (like the -y suffix in English)</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">精神的な問題だ　It's a mental problem.</li>	
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">"精神 (mind)" becomes "精神的な (mental)"</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="に ni">に ni</div>

<p>1) denotes an adverb</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">すぐに着きます　I'll arrive soon.</li>
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">"すぐ (soon)" is the adverb</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>2) together with 的 (てき), can transform any noun or adjective into an adverb (like the -ly suffix in English)</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">直接的に話すべき　We should talk to him directly.</li>
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">"直接 (direct)" becomes "直接的に (directly)"</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>3) denotes the location where the action occurs, or indicates a location as an object</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">私はここに残ります　I'll stay here.</li>
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">"ここ (here)" is the location where the action of "staying" occurs</li>
</ul>
<li class="tod">店に行きます　I'm going to the store.</li>
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">"店 (store)" is the location being used as an object</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>4) denotes an animate object, or an indirect/optional object</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">彼に言いかけた　I spoke to him.</li>
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">"彼 (him)" is the animate object</li>
</ul>
<li class="tod">友達に贈り物をあげた　I gave a gift to my friend.</li>
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">"贈り物 (gift)" is the direct object, while "友達 (friend)" is the indirect one</li>
</ul>　
</ul>	

<p>The direct object is always the one being "given", while the indirect object is the one being "given to". For some verbs, indirect objects are optional.</p>

<p>5) can simply mean "and" between two names</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">明日香に姫子もいた　Asuka and Himeko were there.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="って tte">って tte</div>

<p>1) denotes a quotation (not necessarily verbatim) which may be the subject, context, or an object</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">会長は来週まで休んでって　The boss said take a break until next week.</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that the verb "say" is left completely implied here, because after って tte is used it's already obvious what the action is.</p>

<p>2) in colloquial speech, denotes the context or subject</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">あいつってすごく不気味　That guy's so gross.</li>
</ul>

<p>This does match は wa's meanings exactly, but it is almost exclusively used in colloquial speech.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="Overlaps">Overlaps</div>

<p>As you probably noticed, these basic particles often overlap in meaning. So I've rearranged some of the information down here to help minimize confusion.</p>

<p>Particles that can denote a subject:</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">は wa and が ga are the defaults for this, and should be treated as interchangeable until you have enough experience to know when one or the other is more natural</li>
<li class="tod">も mo strongly implies the existence of another subject</li>
<li class="tod">って tte is an extremely colloquial way of doing it</li>
</ul>

<p>Particles that can denote an object:</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">を wo is the default for this</li>
<li class="tod">と to denotes an object which can be interpreted as a quotation</li>
<li class="tod">に ni denotes either an animate object, or an optional/indirect object</li>
<li class="tod">が ga does this only as special cases: 1) if the noun is inanimate and can't be the subject 2) if the noun is the object of an emotion (only comes up around a small number of specific words like 好き, 嫌い and 怖い)</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also some minor overlap between へ he and に ni when marking locations. 店へ行く is more like "I'll head for/go toward the store" while 店に行く is more like "I'll go to the store". The latter assumes that the destination will be reached and that the journey there is irrelevant.</p>

<p>There is also some minor overlap between の no and な na when marking adjectives. There's no rule of thumb I can give here, since the overlap arises largely because the English and Japanese languages disagree about which words/concepts should be given noun or adjective status.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<h4 id="Sentence Ending Particles or 語尾 gobi">Sentence Ending Particles or 語尾 gobi</h4>

<p>Every Japanese clause ends with a verb (though it may be implied), and possibly one or more of a special set of particles called 語尾 gobi meant to go immediately after said verbs.  Believe it or not, many of these you can actually ignore without changing the meaning of the sentence, so don't obsess over exactly what they mean.  An italicized m or f indicates a gobi which is particularly masculine or feminine.</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">か marks a question (more advanced uses <a class="underscore" href="#Clause-Ending%20か%20ka">later</a>)</li>
<li class="tod">だ or よ simply mark the end of a sentence or add a little emphasis</li>
<li class="tod">です is like だ but somewhat more formal, while っす (m) is somewhat less formal</li>
<li class="tod">ぞ (m) or ぜ (m) are very masculine particles expressing eagerness or excitement</li>
<li class="tod">さ (m) or な place some emphasis on the descriptive words in the clause</li>
<li class="tod">ね (f) is like さ or な but may also ask a question or imply a response of some sort is desired</li>
<li class="tod">だろう (m) and でしょ (f) are like ね but may also mean something is likely to be the case</li>
<li class="tod">の (f) and わ (f) are like ね except they may be used solely for aesthetic reasons</li>
<li class="tod">ん is also aesthetic, but is only used between the verb and some other particle</li>
<li class="tod">じゃない often means "not," but at the end of a sentence can mark a negative rhetorical question</li>
<li class="tod">っけ is a somewhat uncommon combination of って and か often meaning "did/didn't you say _?"</li>
<li class="tod">ってば is an emphatic form of って often equivalent to "I'm telling you _"</li>
<li class="tod">ん is sometimes used to smooth the transition between the end of a verb and the gobi following it, e.g. 思い出すんだ. Occassionally, an ん can even replace the る at the end of an unconjugated verb.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully it is now obvious why I say "thinking in Japanese" is very different from "thinking in English."  Also keep in mind that several of these examples could be translated other ways depending on the context, especially when it comes to plurality, implied subjects and general manner of speaking.</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">には indicates a location and a subject/context at the same time (if location is figurative, "in the case of _")</li>
<li class="tod">には indicates a location and a subject/context at the same time (if location is figurative, "in the case of _")</li>
<li class="tod">にも indicates a location and an additional subject at the same time ("also in the case of _")</li>
<li class="tod">とは indicates a quote-like object and a subject/context at the same time</li>
<li class="tod">とか most literally "and ?," meaning "_ and similar things," "_ and such," or "etc"</li>
<li class="tod">との combines the "with" and "of" meanings to do something like "a [noun] with [noun]", e.g. 彼女との再開 = "a reunion with her"</li>
<li class="tod">のは can indicate an entire clause as the subject/context, or mean "that which is _" or "the fact that _"</li>
<li class="tod">のが same as のは but more likely to mean "that which is _"</li>
<li class="tod">のに same as のは but with an additional "despite" or "even though" nuance</li>
<li class="tod">のを is just short for ものを or "things [object]"</li>
<li class="tod">なの refers to anything which can be described by whatever precedes it; "things which are _"</li>
<li class="tod">での describes a subset or specific instance of something; e.g. "the _ which _ at/with _"</li>
<li class="tod">では indicates a situation and context at the same time; often used as a transition like "in that case"</li>
<li class="tod">へと is a lot like へ, but has a stronger emphasis on the destination than the journey</li>
<li class="tod">への describes a directed subset or specific instance of something;"the _ which _ toward _". For example, 知事への怒り = "the anger directed at the governor".</li>
<li class="tod">だって sometimes just denotes a quote with a だ at the end, but can also act like も, まで or でも with a bit more emphasis</li>
<li class="tod">だっけ is probably just short for だってか, but like っけ itself may also mean"was that what it was/called?"</li>
<li class="tod">なんて and なんか are sometimes like だって, sometimes like のが and sometimes like とか</li>
</ul>

<p>Example sentences using these compound particles can be found at the end of the next section.</p>

<p>I exclude most combinations of gobi from this category because they don't have any special grammatical meaning.  Though they often have gender or formality connotations, those never affect intent or meaning so you can just learn them gradually through experience.</p>

<p>The idea here is to list a few categories of vocabulary which are absolutely essential to understanding Japanese. For the most part, that means how numbers and pronouns work. Not only are those critical in all languages, but the way they work in Japanese is very different from English, so a dictionary alone won't cut it.</p>

<h4 id="Counting Words">Counting Words</h4>

<p>Now that you've seen basic numbers, we can move on to what makes Japanese number usage very different from English number usage: counting words.</p>

<p>This is one of the few categories of vocabulary that not only should but <em>must</em> be explained before you can just look stuff up on your own.  In English, we have the numbers one, two, three and so on, and you say you have one, two or three of something.  In Japanese, you have the numbers いち, に, さん and so on, and instead you say you have ひとつ, ふたつ or みっつ of something.  The first three are just "numbers" while the latter three are "counting words."  It turns out there are several sets of counting words for different kinds of objects.  Irregular ones include:</p>

<ul class="tod">General:
<li class="tod">一つ (ひとつ)</li>
<li class="tod">二つ (ふたつ)</li>
<li class="tod">三つ (みっつ)</li>
<li class="tod">四つ (よっつ)</li>
<li class="tod">五つ (いつつ)</li>
<li class="tod">六つ (むっつ)</li>
<li class="tod">七つ (ななつ)</li>
<li class="tod">八つ (やっつ)</li>
<li class="tod">九つ (ここのつ)</li>
</ul>
<ul class="tod">People:
<li class="tod">一人 (ひとり)</li>
<li class="tod">二人 (ふたり)</li>
<li class="tod">三人 (さんにん)</li>
<li class="tod">四人 (よんにん)</li>
<li class="tod">五人 (ごにん)</li>
</ul>
<ul class="tod">Animals:
<li class="tod">一匹 (いっぴき)</li>
<li class="tod">二匹 (にひき), 三匹 (さんひき)</li>
<li class="tod">四匹 (よんひき)</li>
<li class="tod">五匹 (ごひき) </li>
</ul>
<ul class="tod">Days:
<li class="tod">一日 (いちにち)</li>
<li class="tod">二日 (ふつか)</li>
<li class="tod">三日 (みっか)</li>
<li class="tod">四日 (よっか)</li>
<li class="tod">五日 (いつか)</li>
<li class="tod">六日 (むいか)</li>
<li class="tod">七日 (なのか or なぬか)</li>
<li class="tod">八日 (ようか)</li>
<li class="tod">九日 (ここのか)</li>
<li class="tod">十日 (とおか)</li>
<li class="tod">十一日 (じゅういちにち)</li>
</ul>
<ul class="tod">Months:
<li class="tod">一ヶ月 (いっかげつ)</li>
<li class="tod">二ヶ月 (にかげつ)</li>
<li class="tod">三ヶ月 (さんかげつ)</li>
</ul>
<ul class="tod">Cylindrical or Prism-Shaped objects:
<li class="tod">一本 (いっぽん)</li>
<li class="tod">二本 (にほん or ふたほん)</li>
<li class="tod">三本 (さんほん)</li>
</ul>

<p>Most counting words (including these and other irregulars) are easy to recognize if you're familiar with those above, and easy to look up in any decent dictionary, but you should remember these details:</p>

<ul>
<li>The general counters stop at nine, even though every other set can theoretically go on forever with the same suffix. The closest thing to a general counter above nine would be the ～個 -ko set.</li>
<li>一人 and 二人 are counting words for "one person" and "two people" as well as adjectives meaning "alone" and "together."  一人ぼっち and 二人っきり specify the adjective usage, though 二人っきり tends to be much closer to "just the two of us" than 二人 (and the っきり suffix can be used similarly on 三人 and up as well).</li>
<li>The day counters (like 二日) can indicate days of the month ("the 2nd") as well as numbers of days ("two days").  In contrast, 一月 (いちがつ) only means "January" while 一ヶ月 (いっかげつ) only means "one month."  I have absolutely no explanation for that ヶ.</li>
<li>The suffix 目 (め) changes a "cardinal number" such as 一つ "one" into an "ordinal number" such as 一つ目 "first". So 一日目 means "first day," 二人目 means "second person," etc.</li>
<li>The prefix 何 (なん): 何人 means "how many people?," 何ヶ月 means "how many months?," etc. For the general counters, use 幾つ (いくつ) "how many?".</li>
<li>The prefix 数 (すう): 数日 means "a few days," 十数匹 means "ten and a few animals," 百数十人 means "a hundred and a few tens of people," etc. Be careful not to confuse 十数 with 数十.</li>
<li>When you see something like 二～三十分, it means "twenty to thirty minutes". Not "two to thirty", but "twenty to thirty" (or more literally: "two to three tens of minutes"). This is a really easy mistake to make since in English "twenty" and "thirty" are not the same thing as "two tens" and "three tens".</li>

<p>Again, just need-to-know vocab plus a bunch that a dictionary isn't much good on. By "interrogative" I mean used to ask a question, by "personal" I mean used to denote a person, by "semi-personal" I mean used to denote either a person or a thing, and by "impersonal" I mean used to denote a thing. These are far from strict categories, and are only here to make it a little easier to wrap your head around the very large number of pronouns and other words I've listed.</p>

<p>The vast majority of this section is about verb conjugation. More than anything else, this section illustrates how my approach to language instruction is different from the norm. Here I literally attempt to list every single verb form in the entire language (and some other stuff), whereas a normal textbook would likely spend multiple pages if not entire chapters on each one of these forms (and probably never mention a lot of them).</p>

<p>Obviously, I don't expect you to memorize them all anytime soon. I doubt anyone could without seeing all of them in source material a number of times. So feel free to digest this material at whatever pace you like.</p>

<p>However, the order definitely matters, so don't skip or skim any parts.</p>

<p>You should also be aware that what I describe here, which I call the "gaijin model", is not how the Japanese themselves describe Japanese verb conjugation. They use what I call the "jodoushi model", which is very good for older forms of Japanese but kinda bad with modern Japanese, so I <a class="underscore" href="#The%20Jodoushi%20Model">introduce it</a> in the Old Japanese supplment.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<h4 id="The Basic Verb Forms">The Basic Verb Forms</h4>

<p>Every Japanese verb, in its infinitive form, ends with a "u" sound.  This means it could end in any kana which happens to have a "u" sound.  I call that kana its <strong>verb type</strong>. For instance, かく is a ku-type verb, はしる a ru-type verb, つかう an u-type verb, and so on. </p>

<p>The type of a verb determines precisely which kana each conjugated form will be spelled with.  However, it has absolutely no effect on the meaning of those forms or the verb itself, so you can ignore the details of spelling conjugated verbs for quite some time (hence I put that section near the bottom).</p>

<p>For now, what you want to focus on is the ability to recognize a given form on any verb type.</p>

<p>The basic verb forms you absolutely must know are:</p>

<table class="conjugation">
<tr><th>Verb Form</th><th>Ends in...</th><th>In English, it means...</th><th>Example</th></tr>
<tr><td>Infinitive/Nonpast Form</td><td>"u"</td><td>"to _" or "will _" (nonpast = either present or future)</td><td>なる</td></tr>
<tr><td>Negative Form</td><td>"nai", occasionally just "n"</td><td>"to not _"</td><td>ならない, occasionally ならん</td></tr>
<tr><td>Polite Form</td><td>"masu"</td><td>no meaning, only formality</td><td>なります</td></tr>
<tr><td>Past Form</td><td>"ta", "tta" or "da"</td><td>past tense, "_ed"</td><td>なった</td></tr>
<tr><td>-te Form</td><td>"te" or "de"</td><td>can be a mild command, but usually part of a complex form</td><td>なって</td></tr>
<tr><td>Imperative/Command Form</td><td>"e"</td><td>indicates a strong command</td><td>なれ</td></tr>
<tr><td>Volitional Form</td><td>"ou"</td><td>indicates eagerness or willingness, a little like "I'll _" or "Let's _".</td><td>なろう</td></tr>
<tr><td>Conditional Form</td><td>"eba"</td><td>"if _"</td><td>なれば</td></tr>
<tr><td>Passive Form</td><td>"areru"</td><td>Usually "to be _ed"</td><td>なられる</td></tr>
<tr><td>Potential Form</td><td>"eru"</td><td>"to be able to _"</td><td>なれる</td></tr>
<tr><td>-i Form</td><td>"i"</td><td>can be a gerund, but usually part of a complex form</td><td>なり</td></tr>
<tr><td>Causative Form</td><td>"aseru"</td><td>Usually "to make _" or "to let _"</td><td>ならせる</td></tr>
</table>

<p>When I say a verb form "ends in" something like "areru" I do not necessarily mean the kana あれる.  I mean the sounds.  Verbs in the passive form could end with the kana される, われる, られる, かれる, たれる, ばれる, まれる, なれる, or がれる, depending on verb type.  Again, recognition is what's important here.  Get to the point where seeing all of those kana as the same verb form comes naturally, then worry about how to conjugate each verb yourself.  Similarly, the meanings column is a bit ambiguous because Japanese conjugation is unaffected by grammatical person.  So my "to not _" could easily mean "I won't _", "You won't _", "He won't _", "They won't _" and so on.  Here are a few random examples:</p>

<ul class="tod">私は (I...)
<li class="tod">読める (can read)
<li class="tod">走る (run/will run)
<li class="tod">食べさせる (make _ eat)
<li class="tod">見られる (am seen)
<li class="tod">書いた (wrote)
<li class="tod">します (do/will do)
</ul>

<p>It's also very common for verbs to be conjugated into more than one form at a time:</p>

<ul class="tod">私は (I...)
<li class="tod">読めない (can't read)
<li class="tod">食べさせた (made _ eat)
<li class="tod">見られます (am seen)
</ul>

<p>Once you know all of the common forms, it's possible to conjugate a single verb several times in a row.</p>

<p>Now for some miscellanea:</p>

<ul>
<li>Although the nonpast form can be either present or future tense (as its name implies), it's actually more likely to be future, since the -te iru form is often used to specify present.</li>
<li>The volitional form followed by とする means "to try _ing" as in "to attempt to do _" (this is distinct from the -te みる form below which means "to try _ing" as in "do _ and see what happens").</li>
<li>When a verb is in the passive form, the particle に will correspond to the English particle "by." For example, 本は人に読まれる means "books are read by people."</li>
<li>In extremely formal speech, both the passive and causative forms may be used solely for formality reasons, without any passive or casuative intent. It's very obvious when someone is talking like this, so it shouldn't be too confusing.</li>
<li>In English, the passive voice ("to be _ed") only makes sense with transitive verbs. In Japanese, sometimes it still makes sense to use the passive form on an intransitive verb. If the speaker performs the action, the passive form implies the act is natural or spontaneous rather than deliberate (e.g. あいつのことが思い出される). If someone else performs the action, the passive form implies it affects the speaker (probably negatively), but it's also beyond the speaker's control (e.g., また人に死なれるのは怖い).</li>
<li>When the causative and passive forms are combined, the resulting -aserareru can shorten to -asareru.</li>
<li>Placing そう after a noun or verb means "seems like" or "as if".  For nouns and verbs, its negative is either まい (which is also the negative volitional form below) or そうにない.</li>
</ul>

<table class="conjugation">

<tr><td>-te iru or -teru</td><td>"to be _ing"</td></tr>
<tr><td>-te ita or -teta</td><td>"was _ing" or "have been _ing"</td></tr>
<tr><td>-te aru</td><td>"to be _ing" or "to be/exist in a [verb]ed state"</td></tr>
<tr><td>-te hoshii</td><td>"want _ to _", indicates a desire for someone else to perform the action (contrast with -i tai)</td></tr>
<tr><td>-te oku or -toku</td><td>"to _ in advance/for later"</td></tr>
<tr><td>-te shimau, -chimau or -chau</td><td>can mean "to finish _ing"/"to end", can indicate the action is regrettable or unfortunate, or (especially with -chau) may be used just because it sounds cute</td></tr>
<tr><td>-te yagaru</td><td>indicates contempt for the subject or hatred of the action</td></tr>
<tr><td>-te miru</td><td>"to try _ing", specifically "to try _ and see what happens"</td></tr>
<tr><td>-te iku or -te yuku</td><td>"to keep _ing"</td></tr>
<tr><td>-te tamaru</td><td>"to be able to stand _ing", often used to mean things like "how can I _?" or "I can't just _"</td></tr>
<tr><td>-te kakeru</td><td>"to start _ing" or "to almost _"</td></tr>

<tr><td>-te kuru</td><td>"to go/come and _" or "to _ and go/come"</td></tr>
<tr><td>-te wa or -cha</td><td>"if/then/in the case of _", probably identical to the word じゃ</td></tr>
</table>

<p>There are some other verbs and adjectives which can be placed after the -te form, but their meanings in this case are identical to their normal meanings and thus there is absolutely no need to list them. Admittedly, the -te kuru form is usually like this, but it happens to be extremely common and occasionally gets used a bit oddly.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="Modal -te Forms">Modal -te Forms</div>

<p>Here are what I call the "modal" -te forms, because they're the closest thing I know of to explicit grammatical modes in Japanese. Unsurprisingly, these are probably the hardest ones to explain or understand.  It may be best to find an example or two in source material before trying to make sense out of these.</p>

<table class="conjugation">
<tr><th>Verb Form</th><th>In English, it means..</th></tr>
<tr><td>-te ageru or -tageru</td><td>literally "to give", sometimes adapted as "_ for you" indicates an action the speaker performed for the benefit of another may express benevolence or generosity</td></tr>
<tr><td>-te kureru</td><td>literally "to give", sometimes adapted as "_ for me" indicates an action someone performed for the speaker's benefit may express gratitude or appreciation</td></tr>
<tr><td>-te morau</td><td>literally "to take", sometimes adapted as "have you _" indicates an action the speaker performed for his or her own benefit, often as the expense of someone else may express dominance or control</td></tr>
</table>

<hr class="dotted">

<h4 id="-i Forms">-i Forms</h4>

<table class="conjugation">
<tr><th>Verb Form</th><th>In English, it means...</th></tr>
<tr><td>-i</td><td>being a gerund, it's often best defined as "the act of _ing", and occasionally as "one who _s"</td></tr>
<tr><td>-i masu</td><td>this is the same Polite Form defined earlier</td></tr>
<tr><td>-i tai</td><td>"want to _", indicates a desire to perform the action oneself (contrast with its passive form, -te hoshii)</td></tr>
<tr><td>-i nasai or -i na</td><td>a softer (usually feminine) command form, often with a chiding nuance</td></tr>
<tr><td>-i tamae</td><td>a command form used by those with higher social status</td></tr>
<tr><td>-i [adjective]</td><td>"[adjective] to _", for example 読み難い = "hard to read"</td></tr>
<tr><td>-i ni [verb]</td><td>"[verb] in order to _", for example 走りに行く = "to go somewhere to run"</td></tr>
</table>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="Compound Verbs">Compound Verbs</div>

<p>The last important -i form is simply putting a verb after it, which creates what I call a "compound verb."  Since this can be done between virtually any two verbs, many of the -te forms listed above can also be made using the -i form, and it's worth showing a whole table of examples.  So here I've listed a few very common ones, plus all the ones I know of that have special meanings.  You may notice that Japanese compound verbs often correspond to English phrasal verbs.</p>

<table class="conjugation">
<tr><th>Verb Form</th><th>In English, it means...</th></tr>
<tr><td>-i komu</td><td>"to _ into" or "to _ over"</td></tr>
<tr><td>-i dasu</td><td>"to _ out" or "to _ away"</td></tr>

<tr><td>-i au</td><td>"to _ each other"</td></tr>
<tr><td>-i ageru</td><td>"to _ up" (notice this has nothing to do with -te ageru)</td></tr>
<tr><td>-i sugiru</td><td>"to overdo _" or "to do _ too much" or "to do _ too often"</td></tr>
<tr><td>-i tate</td><td>"something which has just been _ed"</td></tr>
<tr><td>-i makuru</td><td>"to do _ with reckless abandon," or when that makes no sense "to _ to a ridiculous extent"</td></tr>
<tr><td>-i kakaru</td><td>"to be on the verge of _ing" or "to _ at/to/toward someone or something"</td></tr>
<tr><td>-i ppanasu</td><td>"to _ and then leave that way"</td></tr>
<tr><td>-i kaneru and -i kanenai</td><td>"to be unable to _" and "to be unable to not _"</td></tr>

<p>That is <strong>all</strong> of the verb forms you might have to learn to reach Conversational Fluency.  Now here's a bunch of examples of conjugating multiple times in a row:</p>

<p>走る to run → 走って run → 走っていく to keep running → 走っていこう let's keep running</p>

<p>言う to say → 言われる to be said → 言われ act of _ being said → 言われたい to want _ to be said → 言われたくない to not want _ to be said</p>

<p>作る to make → 作って make → 作ってくれる to make _ for me → 作ってくれて make _ for me → 作ってくれてありがとう thank you for making _ for me</p>

<p>笑う to laugh → 笑い act of laughing → 笑いあう to laugh at each other → 笑いあえる to be able to laugh at each other → 笑いあえれば if _ can laugh at each other</p>

<p>見る to see → 見 act of seeing → 見に行く to go to see → 見に行って go to see → 見に行ってあげる to go see _ for someone → 見に行ってあげて go see _ for someone → 見に行ってあげてしまう regrettably go see _ for someone → 見に行ってあげてしまった regrettably went to see _ for someone</p>

<p>With enough experience, things like たくない, しまった and ってあげる will start to feel like single steps, and even conjugations like 見に行ってあげてしまった will become natural, despite the fact that English can never conjugate a single verb that much.</p>

<p>Now for a bunch of example sentences using conjugated verbs. The format here is the same as before, though since I'm using a lot more verb forms, it's worth explicitly stating that each step of conjugation is done on a separate line in the breakdown (though you may have noticed that already).</p>

<p>You may be wondering if there are any rules there are governing the order which forms can be applied to verbs. There definitely are, but I don't think it's worth the effort to try and come up with a set of rules myself, or make you learn one. The language is very consistent with what orders it chooses, so by the time you've mastered the forms themselves, you'll have naturally picked up more than enough of the ordering rules.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<h4 id="Advanced Verbs Forms and Uses">Advanced Verbs Forms and Uses</h4>

<p>Up until now, I've been defining each form with one sentence or less. Now we're going to look at the forms where that simply isn't an option, as well as some additional uses of forms you already know. For the most part, this is because these forms affect the meaning of the entire sentence and not just that of the verb, which makes them significantly more difficult.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="-ra Form">-ra Form</div>

<p>Either the infinitive plus "nara" or the past plus "ra" (usually "tara").  "nara"  usually means "if _" and applies to the entire clause, not just the verb, while "tara" tends to mean "if/when" and applies to just the verb.  The conditional "eba" form is different from both in that it has no temporal implications.  It's hard to explain this with examples, but:</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">店に行けば買うかも。</li>
<li class="tod">= If _ goes to the store _ might buy it.</li>
<li class="tod">店に行くなら買うかも。</li>
<li class="tod">= If _ is going/will go to the store then _ might buy it.</li>
<li class="tod">店に行ったら買うかも。</li>
<li class="tod">= "_ might buy it if/when _ goes to the store." or "If _ went to the store _ might buy it."</li>
</ul>

<div class="guideheading" id="Conjunctive -te">Conjunctive -te</div>

<p>Yet another use of the -te form (and slightly less often, the -i form).  If a verb in the -te form isn't part of some complex form, and a mild command makes no sense, then the -te is meant to act as a conjunction (specifically "and") between this verb and whatever verb comes next.  Two or more verbs may be connected in this way (keep using -te until the last one), and there may or may not be other words between them.  Also, these -te verbs effectively borrow their tense/mood/etc. from the final verb in the sentence.</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">走って勝った</li>
<li class="tod">= _ ran and won</li>
<li class="tod">落ち着いて考えれば</li>
<li class="tod">= If _ calms down and thinks</li>
<li class="tod">起きて、学校に行って、帰って、眠りたいだけ</li>
<li class="tod">= _ just wants to wake up, go to school, come home, and sleep</li>
</ul>

<p>As a side note, a -te form by itself can sometimes be an indicator of uncertainty rather than a mild command.  I believe that's a result of this conjunctive -te, but that's debatable.</p>

<p>The quasi-particle し can also be placed after a verb (in various forms) or an adjective to do basically the same things.</p>

<div class="guideheading" id="-tari Form">-tari Form</div>

<p>Spelling it is easy: it's the past form with り added.  Understanding it isn't much harder.  I interpret it as a series of actions taken as a single whole.  It may also help to see it as a tendency or disposition to perform the action, or as an action repeated or spread out over a long period of time.  Strangely, English tends to implicitly take care of this nuance for you, so translating it is simply a matter of using the generic mood.  Also, this form is just as conjunctive as the -te form.</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">忘れたりけど、まだできる。</li>
<li class="tod">I may forget things, but I can still do it.</li>
<li class="tod">君は戦ったり勝ったり幸せになる。</li>
<li class="tod">You find happiness in fighting and winning.</li>
</ul>

<div class="guideheading" id="Modal Implications of Conditional Forms">Modal Implications of Conditional Forms</div>

<p>The basic idea is that after certain verb forms (usually conditionals) you can place a word meaning either "good" or "bad."  Sometimes, this makes perfect sense if you understand conditionals to begin with.  Other times, it seems odd because the meanings of certain popular combinations have drifted much closer to modal words like "should" or "must."  The main ones to be wary of are:</p>

<table class="conjugation">
<tr><th>Conditional-esque Form(s)</th><th>"good"/"bad" Word(s)</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr><td>～temo</td><td>いい</td><td>"may _" or "can _"</td></tr>
<tr><td>～eba/[infinitive] ga</td><td>いい</td><td>"should" or "can (without difficulty)"</td></tr>
<tr><td>～te</td><td>ならない</td><td>"must", "need to" or "have to"</td></tr>
<tr><td>～nakereba/neba/nakya/nakute/nai to</td><td>いけない/ならない/だめ</td><td>"must", "need to" or "have to"</td></tr>
<tr><td>～nakereba/neba/nakya/nakute/nai to</td><td>いい</td><td>"don't need to" or "don't have to"</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Some of the conditional forms listed above will look new or strange. This is largely because [infinitive]が and [negative]と are used almost exclusively for these modal uses. That and "nakute" is a result of adjective conjugation (the next section).</p>

<p>The genuinely tricky part is that the word for good/bad might be <strong>implied</strong>, giving you lines like "if I don't go..." which actually mean "I have to go." This is probably the single easiest way to get a line completely wrong without even knowing you're missing something.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<h4 id="Adjective Conjugation">Adjective Conjugation</h4>

<p>Japanese is kinda weird in that it lets adjectives have tense and mood to some degree, but it's not hard to learn since you already know verb conjugation. Yes, it technically should be called adjective declension, but it's so similar to conjugation that I prefer to call it that instead.  By the way, all Japanese adjectives end in either い or な, hence "-i adjective" and "-na adjective".  First, -i adjectives:</p>

<table class="conjugation">
<tr><td>Default form</td><td>早い（はやい）</td><td>fast</td></tr>
<tr><td>Negative form</td><td>早くない</td><td>not fast</td></tr>
<tr><td>Past form</td><td>早かった</td><td>was fast</td></tr>
<tr><td>-te form</td><td>早くて or 早いし</td><td>fast (always a conjunctive -te, never a command or part of a complex form)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Adverb</td><td>早く</td><td>fastly/quickly</td></tr>
<tr><td>Noun form</td><td>早さ</td><td>fastness/speed</td></tr>
<tr><td>Apparent form</td><td>早そう</td><td>seems fast/seemingly fast/likely to be fast</td></tr>
<tr><td>Negative Apparent form</td><td>早くなさそう</td><td>seems not fast/seemingly not fast</td></tr>
<tr><td>Conditional form</td><td>早ければ</td><td>if _ is fast</td></tr>
</table>

<p>As for な adjectives (which are often just nouns with な attached), the only forms they can have are な, じゃない, だった, そう and さ.  It should be obvious what those mean without a separate chart.  The gobi だ can also become だった or じゃない in a verbless clause or sentence.</p>

<p>Now the weird part: a few verb forms are technically adjectives.  Specifically, the negative (nai) form, the -i tai form, and the -te hoshii form (but definitely not the -i form) can be further conjugated this way, as well as ない and じゃない themselves.  In fact, the "past negative" -nakatta and "negative conditional" -nakereba forms listed above (as well as the "negative adverb" -naku form) are merely the most common ways in which adjective conjugation affects verb forms.  So expect to see lots of stuff like -i たくない and -te ほしかった.</p>

<p>There's also a "-garu form" where the い changes to がる, and the result is a verb meaning "to feel that _ is _". I didn't list this because it's only ever used on a small subset of adjectives that can be easily interpreted as feelings. For instance, 寂しがる means "to feel that _ is lonely" and 不思議がる means "to feel that _ is strange/mysterious", but no one would ever say 早がる.</p>

<ul>Some miscellaneous comments:
<li>There are a few adjectives ending in ない despite neither being verbs nor being conjugated in any way.  The most common of these is probably 危ない(あぶない).  Don't get confused; it's not the negative of anything.</li>
<li>A common application of the adverb form of adjectives is attaching them to the verb なる.  For example, 高くなる means "to become tall." This can also happen on adjectival verb forms. For example, 行きたくなる means "to start wanting to go".</li>
<li>いい becomes よい for conjugation (よかった, よくない, etc.), and its apparent form is よさそう.</li>
<li>Replace any adjective's い or な with すぎ to mean "too _."  いい and ない are irregular since they become よさすぎ and なさすぎ.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="Spelling Conjugated Verbs">Spelling Conjugated Verbs</h4>

<div class="guideheading">Ichidan versus Godan</div>

<p>一段 ichidan and 五段 godan are the two major categories the Japanese break their verbs into.  Ichidan consist of about half of the "ru" type verbs, and are labeled as "1ru" in the chart below.  All other verbs are godan, including the other "ru" verbs which I labeled "5ru."  Thankfully, ichidan verbs always end in either "eru" or "iru," which makes their odd forms a little easier to recognize.</p>

<p>As for telling what's ichi and what's go, you're screwed.  There's absolutely no way to tell other than memorization or experience (although edict entries will conveniently indicate them with v1 and v5).</p>

<p>Columns for the more complex forms are completely unnecessary once you know that the polite form is a "su" type verb, the negative form is an adjective, and the causative/passive/potential forms are all "1ru" type verbs.  Now for another list of little details to watch out for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Notice the "1ru" type's -i form can end in "e" rather than "i".  This isn't as annoying as it might look since these verbs are almost never used in the command form and their -i forms are very often used in compound verbs, which makes them nice and obvious. Also, the "1ru" type has an alternative command form ending in ろ (don't confuse this with the volitional form), and its passive and potential forms are identical.</li>
<li>Among the irregularities not covered by this chart are: 行く's -te form is 行って, its past form is 行った, the negative of ある is ない, the negative of ます is ません. <a class="underscore" href="#Formal%20Verbs">Formal verbs</a> also have some weird behavior.</li>
<li>Kanji for popular verbs often have multiple verb readings, and occasionally you might misread one as a conjugated form of another.  The most annoying example I know of: 合わせる can be either potential of 合わす or causative of 合う.  Thankfully both interpretations mean almost the same thing.  Kanji with this nuisance include 合, 見 and 思. This is partly because, <a class="underscore" href="#List%20of%20Chuukogo%20Verb%20Forms">in old Japanese</a>, the causative form was -asu instead of -aseru.</li>
<li>Out of all the kanji representing multiple verbs, there's an interesting subcategory in which the kanji represents a pair of verbs where one is intransitive and the other transitive.  Often, these are identical except for an "a" sound in the stem of one verb which gets replaced by an "e" sound in the other.  For example, 止まる means "to stop" while 止める means "to stop (something)", and 隠れる means "to hide (oneself)" while 隠す means "to hide (something)".</li>
<li>Since 見る is a 1ru type, みたい can be either the -i tai form of 見る, the -i tai form of the -te miru form, or the "seems like" word mentioned in <a class="underscore" href="#Grammatical%20Vocabulary">Grammatical Vocabulary</a>.  And those all mean slightly different things. Have fun not getting confused by this.</li>
<li>Finally, since this (important) detail doesn't fit anywhere, I'll just tack it on at the end. Young masculine speech often changes "ai", "oi" or "ui" sounds to "ee" for no particular reason.  Among the most common results of this are ない becoming ねえ,  すごい becoming すげえ and the -i たい form becoming -i てえ.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dotted">

<p>For many this material will be especially tricky, since the rules I can give are not as rigorous or as thorough as before. In fact most of the page is spent listing special cases. We're getting to the point where you really do have to "think in Japanese" to get this stuff.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<h4 id="Clauses Introduction">Introduction</h4>

<p>The quintessential rule in complex Japanese grammar (in my opinion) is that a verb always ends a clause.  This usually also means it ends the sentence (especially if sentence ending particles come after it), unless:</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">1) the verb is conjugated to some connective form (-te, -i, -eba, -nakereba, -nai to, nara, -tara, etc)</li>
<li class="tod">2) the verb is immediately followed by a compound particle or quote-marking particle</li>
<li class="tod">3) the verb is immediately followed by a noun phrase</li>
</ul>

<p>Case 1 was thoroughly dealt with by the last page (<a class="underscore" href="#Conjugation">Conjugation</a>), while case 2 was largely handled by <a class="underscore" href="#Particles">Particles</a> and the examples in Vocabulary which use compound particles.  Most of this page is about the potentially confusing case 3 (and how 2 is sometimes a special case of 3).</p>

<p>Long story short: if the verb at the end of a clause is immediately followed by a noun phrase, then the clause is describing the noun somehow.</p>

<p>Most likely, the clause is simply an action performed by said noun.  A literal translation in these instances will often use a relative pronoun (e.g. "who"/"which"/"that").  For these first examples, I'll put subordinate clauses inside parenthesis for clarity.</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">犯罪者を捕まった警察者がメダルを貰った</li>
<li class="tod">(criminal [object] to capture/arrest(past)) police officer [subject] medal [object] to receive(past)</li>
<li class="tod">The police officer (who caught the criminal) received a medal.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">疲れた俺がもう動き出してる電車を追えない</li>
<li class="tod">(to get tired(past)) I [subject] (already to start to move(-teru)) train [object] to chase(potential(negative))</li>
<li class="tod">I (who was tired) cannot chase the train (which is already starting to move).</li>
</ul>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">まだ真空管を使ってる古いコンピュターはもういらない</li>
<li class="tod">still vacuum tube [object] to use(-teru) old computer [subject] to need(negative)</li>
<li class="tod">I no longer need an old computer (which is still using vacuum tubes).</li>
</ul>

<p>The only restriction on what verb forms can be used at the end of a subordinate clause is that the clause must not end in one of the aforementioned "connective forms." That means it'll usually be infinitive, past, ~te iru or ~te ita form.</p>

<p>And keep in mind that, if it makes no sense for the noun to be performing the action, then the clause is describing it some other way.  For example, the clause may be an action that is to be performed using the noun, or an ability of the noun, or even something the noun causes (more precisely, this means the causative/potential/passive forms can all be implied on top of the usual subject/object implication).  However, this is quite rare.  By the time you have to worry about it, it'll come to you naturally anyway.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<h4 id="List of Clause-Ending Nouns">List of Clause-Ending Nouns</h4>

<pSo, a guide can't help teach you every way a noun phrase can be modified by a subordinate clause.  However, it can list and explain all of the nouns which do unique things when used under such a clause.  A <strong>clause-ending noun</strong> is my term for nouns which have special meanings or uses when they end clauses, separate from what they would mean anywhere else in the sentence.  Many of the ones I list below will have definitions both as ordinary and clause-ending nouns, so try not to get confused.  And of course it's subjective what counts as a "special meaning," so a few of them you may feel are just words that often get used to end clauses but still mean the same thing.></p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="事 koto">事 koto</div>

<p>Literally means "thing," "fact" or "matter."  As a clause ender it may also mean "the act of _ing," "things which _" or "instances/occurrences of _."</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">借金を持つことは変更してない</li>
<li class="tod">The fact that I have a debt is not changing.</li>
<li class="tod">大統領になることに苦労はある</li>
<li class="tod">There are hardships in (the act of) becoming president.</li>
<li class="tod">知っていることが多すぎて怖い</li>
<li class="tod">The things that I know are too many, and I'm afraid.</li>
<li class="tod">試験で満点をとったことはない</li>
<li class="tod">There is no instance of me getting/I have never gotten a perfect score on a test.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, this technically isn't relevant, but のこと is effectively an emphatic を to be used after an animate object or when discussing emotions.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="癖 kuse">癖 kuse</div>

<p>Literally "habit."  When followed by に it's effectively the same as 事 koto except it implies criticism or blame (often with anger).  Otherwise, treat it like an ordinary noun.</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">あなたも落ちたくせになんで私を責める?</li>
<li class="tod">You failed too, why are you blaming me?</li>
<li class="tod">何も知らないくせに俺の有罪を決める?</li>
<li class="tod">I can't decide if I'm guilty when you don't know anything.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="物 or 者 mono">物 or 者 mono</div>

<p>Literally "thing" or "person" depending on the kanji.  May be either if in kana.  Often overlaps with 事 koto.</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">この事件に関するものを全部隠さない?</li>
<li class="tod">You must hide all things/people which relate to this incident.</li>
<li class="tod">信教を持つものだけに救済ある</li>
<li class="tod">Salvation exists only for persons who have faith.</li>
</ul>

<p>Can also be colloquially shortened to もん, and used as a feminine gobi much like よ in short or long form.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="側 gawa">側 gawa</div>

<p>Literally "side" (of a debate or issue) and is effectively the collective noun for 者 mono, meaning it refers to a group or type of people (especially an opinionated one).</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">噂を信じてる側がうるさくなってる</li>
<li class="tod">The ones who believe the rumor are getting louder/more vocal.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="時 toki 頃 koro うち uchi and 度 tabi">時 toki, 頃 koro, うち uchi and 度 tabi</div>

<p>All of these literally mean "time."  As a clause-ender 時 toki usually means "the time when _."  If followed by に it means "at the time when _" or "at the same time as _."  頃 koro is the same, but more likely to indicate a long period of time in the past.  うち uchi is more likely to indicate a short period of time near the present.  たび tabi is more likely to indicate one of several similar periods of time.</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">大学にいた時を思い出すと懐かしい</li>
<li class="tod">It is nostalgic when I remember (the time) when I was in college.</li>
<li class="tod">猫が食らい付いた時に鼠はもう死んでいる</li>
<li class="tod">When the cat bit into the mouse it was already dead.</li>
<li class="tod">小学校にいる頃には問題児だった</li>
<li class="tod">I was a problem child back when I was in elementary school.</li>
<li class="tod">宿題をやってるうちに妹が悪戯をした</li>
<li class="tod">My little sister played a prank while I was doing homework.</li>
<li class="tod">家に帰るたびにほっとした気分になる</li>
<li class="tod">Each time I/As I return home, I feel relieved.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="前 mae and 後 ato">前 mae and 後 ato</div>

<p>The words themselves are pretty easy: "in front" vs. "behind", "before" vs. "after" and "previous" vs. "next."  They also mean "before/after" as clause-ending nouns, but for some reason students seem to misinterpret them a lot, so they're listed here.  Also, I think 後's "nochi" reading is unique to clause-ending.</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">家を出る前に歯を磨かないとダメ.</li>
<li class="tod">I have to brush my teeth before leaving the house..</li>
<li class="tod">授業が終わるあと、公園で散歩したい.</li>
<li class="tod">After class ends, I'd like to take a walk in the park..</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="積もり tsumori">積もり tsumori</div>

<p>Literally "intention" or "plan."  As a clause ender it means "intent to _," "the thought/belief that _," "to plan/intend on _" or "to think/believe that _ is the case."</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">今年で運転免許を取るつもりです</li>
<li class="tod">I plan on getting my driver's license this year.</li>
<li class="tod">てめらを殺したつもりだった</li>
<li class="tod">I thought I killed you bastards.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="気 ki">気 ki</div>

<p>Literally "spirit" (see <a class="underscore" href="#Confusing%20Vocabulary">Confusing Vocabulary</a> for its usage in idioms).  Overlaps with tsumori.  As a clause-ender it means "intent/inclination to _," "to intend on _," "to be in the mood to/for _" or "to feel like _."</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">やっと教授と喋る気になった</li>
<li class="tod">I finally became inclined to/felt like talking with my professor.</li>
<li class="tod">肉を食べる気がない</li>
<li class="tod">I have no inclination to eat/am not in the mood to eat/don't feel like eating meat.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="様 you">様 you</div>

<p>Literally "manner" or "appearance."  As a clause ender, with no adjacent particle,  it means "it seems to be the case that _." </p>

<p>If you add certain particles, you get similies.</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">XようにY means "to Y as if Xing".</li>
<li class="tod">XようなY means "a Y which seems to be X".</li>
<li class="tod">XのようにY means "to Y like an X".</li>
<li class="tod">XのようなY means "a Y which seems like an X".</li>
<li class="tod">Xように can also mean "in order to X" or "so that X may be so".</li>
</ul>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">ここに車がないようだ?</li>
<li class="tod">It seems there are no cars here.</li>
<li class="tod">壊れているように怖い音を発した</li>
<li class="tod">It emitted a scary sound as if it was broken.</li>
<li class="tod">すごく痛いような仕草で説明した</li>
<li class="tod">He explained it with mannerisms as if it was incredibly painful.</li>
<li class="tod">俺はサラリーマンのように働いた</li>
<li class="tod">I worked like a salaryman.</li>
<li class="tod">死んだ魚のような目で見つめた</li>
<li class="tod">He gazed with eyes like a dead fish.</li>
<li class="tod">世界が平和でありますよう?</li>
<li class="tod">So the world be at peace. or So that the world may be at peace.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="風 fuu">風 fuu</div>

<p>Much the same as 様 you, but it only means "manner," not "appearance."  The "as if" and "like a" definitions above apply to 風 fuu as well, but not the others.  As a result, particles are much more optional.</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">こんな激しい風に終わりたくなかった</li>
<li class="tod">I didn't want it to end in this violent a manner/so violently.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="為 tame">為 tame</div>

<p>Literally "sake" or "cause."  As a clause ender, unsurprisingly, means "for the sake of _," "in order to _" or "as a result of _."</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">基地を守るために撤退せねばならん</li>
<li class="tod">We must retreat for the sake of protecting/in order to protect the base.</li>
<li class="tod">この計画の全ては正義のた?</li>
<li class="tod">All of this plan is for (the sake/cause of) justice.</li>
<li class="tod">寝過ぎたため、学校に遅れました</li>
<li class="tod">As a result of/Because I overslept, I was late for school.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="甲斐 kai">甲斐 kai</div>

<p>Literally "effect/result" or "worth/use/avail."  As a clause ender, it means the latter.</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">徹夜をする甲斐があったみたい</li>
<li class="tod">It seems it was worth pulling an all-nighter.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="訳 wake">訳 wake</div>

<p>Most literally, "a set of circumstances surrounding an action or situation."  Sometimes translates to "reason," "circumstance," "way," "meaning," "situation" and so on.  When in Japanese you say a 訳 wake ある exists or ない doesn't exist, you mean that there is or is not a plausible reason for something to be the case (the latter may be translated "there's no way").  If there is no explicit verb and the sentence just ends with 訳 wake and maybe a gobi, then it is an explanation of the circumstances surrounding some situation.</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">電車が遅れてる訳を聞きたくない</li>
<li class="tod">I don't want to hear the reason why the train is late.</li>
<li class="tod">今全員犯人を追ってるわけで誰もいない</li>
<li class="tod">Everyone's chasing the criminal right now so no one's here.</li>
<li class="tod">月まで飛ぶことができるわけがない</li>
<li class="tod">There's no way you can jump as far as/all the way to the moon.</li>
<li class="tod">今月だけは違う仕事をしてるわけだ</li>
<li class="tod">Just for this month I'm doing a different job.</li>
</ul>

<p>Incidentally, the phrase というわけだ is a common way of ending an explanation (especially a long one), and the phrase というわけで is a common way of transitioning from one subject to another.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="儘 mama">儘 mama</div>

<p>Most literally, a "state of being" or "tendency of progression."  Most often used in conditional statements to mean "given this state/condition/trend" which often translates to "like this," "in this condition," "at this rate," "if this keeps up" or "with the way _ is/are."  When it ends a clause, the clause is describing the state.</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">このままでは公平な大会にならない</li>
<li class="tod">Given this trend/At this rate it won't be a fair tournament.</li>
<li class="tod">扉が開いたまま残したことはない</li>
<li class="tod">The door has never remained in an opened state/been left open.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="程 hodo">程 hodo</div>

<p>Most literally, "the degree or extent to which an action is performed."  Sometimes translates directly to "degree," "extent" or "limit."  As a clause ender it can be a standard noun meaning one of those three things.  It can also be "no more than _" (especially if ending the sentence) or "to the point that _." Sometimes you'll see a phrase like "[verb]hodo[verb]" which means "[verb] to the extent that [verb]" i.e. "the more _ [verb] the more _ [verb]."</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">殺すほど傷付けるつもりじゃない</li>
<li class="tod">I don't plan on hurting him to such a degree that/so much that he dies.</li>
<li class="tod">皆が言うほど悪いじゃないよ</li>
<li class="tod">He's not bad to the extent that/as bad as everyone says.</li>
<li class="tod">高校をギリギリ卒業したほどのものだ</li>
<li class="tod">He's no more than a person who barely graduated high school.</li>
<li class="tod">働いすぎるほど狂うと思う</li>
<li class="tod">I think the more he overworks, the more insane he'll get.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="所為 sei and お蔭 okage">所為 sei and お蔭 okage</div>

<p>所為 sei is literally "cause," "reason" or "fault."  Identical to the "as a result of _" meaning of 為 tame, except it implies anger or blame.  Its opposite, お蔭 okage, literally means "assistance" and also has 為 tame's "result" meaning, but implies gratitude instead.</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">君のせいでこの捜索は無能だった</li>
<li class="tod">This investigation accomplished nothing because of you.</li>
<li class="tod">俺が勝ったのはコーチのおかげだ</li>
<li class="tod">The fact that I won is because of/thanks to my coach.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="振り furi">振り furi</div>

<p>Literally "pretense," "appearance" or "behavior."  As a clause ender it almost always means "pretending to _" or "acting as if _," and it's often written in katakana when used this way.</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">でも恥ずかしかったから気付かないフリをした</li>
<li class="tod">But it was embarrassing so I pretended not to notice.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="所 tokoro">所 tokoro</div>

<p>Literally "situation," often "place" and/or "time."  Can also mean "parts that _," "the part when _," "something like _," "what someone looks/acts like when _ing" or refer to a certain "side" of someone.  Also, the phrase ところで by itself is roughly equivalent to "speaking of which" in English.  Finally, ところ is interchangeable with とこ and どころ.</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">人がいないところでいたくない</li>
<li class="tod">I don't want to be in a place where there are no people.</li>
<li class="tod">俺が見たところによるといいかもしれない</li>
<li class="tod">Based on the parts I saw/what I saw it might be good.</li>
<li class="tod">事件が終わったところであいつが現れた</li>
<li class="tod">That guy appeared (at the part) when the incident ended.</li>
<li class="tod">あなたの焦っているところも見たい</li>
<li class="tod">I also want to see what you look/act like when you're under pressure.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="場合 baai">場合 ba'ai</div>

<p>Arguably the more figurative version of 所 tokoro, meaning "situation" as in "time" or "place" as well as in "position," "role" or "standing."  No weird alternate meanings on this one.</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">遊んでる場合じゃないって</li>
<li class="tod">I'm saying this is no time to be playing.</li>
<li class="tod">社長の場合でミスは許されない</li>
<li class="tod">Mistakes are unforgivable in a company president's position.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="より yori">より yori</div>

<p>Means "more than," but once again backwards compared to English.  Also, the thing being compared to may be implied, or entirely unnecessary.</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">猫よりかわいい生き物はないと思う</li>
<li class="tod">I think there is no animal more cute/cuter than a cat.</li>
<li class="tod">より賢い解答を探しています</li>
<li class="tod">I'm searching for a more intelligent answer.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="方 hou">方 hou</div>

<p>Literally "way" or "option," but its most common usage by far is in comparisons.  In Japanese, when you say a 方 hou is [adjective], you almost always mean that whatever's describing the 方 hou is more [adjective] than some other thing (which is either implied or specified with yori).  Also, 方 kata after a gerund means "way of _ing" or "how to _."</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">撃ち合いで勝つより目立てず方がいい</li>
<li class="tod">It's more good/better to not stand out than to win in a firefight.</li>
<li class="tod">科学には詳しい人の方が好ましい</li>
<li class="tod">In science, the knowledgeable person is more desirable.</li>
<li class="tod">早いほうが勝算高いって言ったよ</li>
<li class="tod">I said the fast option/doing it faster has a higher chance of success.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="筈 hazu and べき beki">筈 hazu and べき beki</div>

<p>You've seen these in <a class="underscore" href="#Grammatical%20Vocabulary">Grammatical Vocabulary</a>.  筈 hazu is a clause ender just like anything else in this list, but べき beki is an adjectival verb form which attaches to the infinitive/nonpast form, making it a grammatical oddity.</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">すぐ帰ってくるはずから待つべきだ</li>
<li class="tod">Since he should come home soon, we should wait for him.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="Miscellaneous Clause-Related Issues">Miscellaneous Clause-Related Issues</h4>

<p>If you've been seriously attempting to read source material up to this point, then most of the subsections below will probably cover things you've more or less figured out on your own (consciously or otherwise). My goal in talking about them is not so much to teach you new things, as it is to give you an idea of how well you intuitively understand Japanese, and get you to start consciously thinking about some of the more subtle and complex issues with Japanese grammar (especially in contrast with English) which you might not have noticed.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="Ambiguity and Context">Ambiguity and Context</div>

<p>There are two quick things I'd like to show you to get you thinking about some of the more subtle issues that come up once you can understand multi-clause sentences.</p>

<p>First, the subject of the subordinate clause is not necessarily the noun it modifies.  Even the object (if any) doesn't have to be located anywhere in the clause.  Instead it may be in a previous sentence or clause, or it may be the "context" denoted by は.  Since this is only useful or common during a long conversation where the subjects and objects intended gradually become obvious, there's not much point in giving more than one simple example here:</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">何をあげたらいいと思う？</li>
<li class="tod">What do you think I should give her?</li>
<li class="tod">あげたいもの</li>
<li class="tod">Something you want to give her.</li>
</ul>

<p>That example should also make it very clear what I meant at the beginning when I said Japanese relies on context and leaves things implied a lot more than English.</p>

<p>Second, consider this sentence: 脱出するものは支援せよといったから行く。 Obviously, there are two subordinate clauses (if you interpret the quote as a clause).  However, it is not clear whether the second subordinate clause encompasses the first one or not, giving us two valid but very different meanings:</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">"(those who escape [subject] reinforce) said [so] go"</li>
<li class="tod">= "We're going because he said to backup anyone who escapes."</li>
<li class="tod">"(those who escape) [subject] (reinforce) said [so] go"</li>
<li class="tod">= "We're going because the escapees said to back those guys up."</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that, without any context, it is impossible to tell which of these two interpretations is correct.  Fortunately, in context, it will usually be very easy to tell which meaning is intended.</p>

<p>Also, the distinction between は and が is relevant here, since が is more likely to be found inside a subordinate clause and は less so (though if context, tone of voice or anything else imply the contrary, follow those cues instead).  On occasion you may be able to eliminate one or the other option by noticing a particular verb is strictly intransitive.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="Clause-Ending か ka">Clause-Ending か ka</div>

<p>When a subordinate clause ends in か, and is therefore a question, you don't actually need a noun.  In this case the clause represents either the question itself, or its answer.  It can also express a possible reason for something described by the next clause.  Multiple か ka clauses in parallel usually mean "whether/or"</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">あいつが何を知ってるかを調べなきゃ</li>
<li class="tod">What does he know? We must investigate.</li>
<li class="tod">We must investigate what that guy knows.</li>
<li class="tod">建物が古いか新しいかは関係ない</li>
<li class="tod">Is the building old? New? It's irrelevant.</li>
<li class="tod">It's irrelevant whether the building is old or new.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="Tenses In Subordinate Clauses">Tenses In Subordinate Clauses</div>

<p>Interpreting a single tense in a single clause is generally pretty simple, since many of the most basic tenses in Japanese can be accurately equated with basic English tenses. However, the way you interpret tenses of verbs in subordinate clauses can be subtly different. Consider the following sentence:</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">考えるうちに授業が終わった</li>
<li class="tod">Class ended while I was thinking.</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that 考える is in nonpast form, even though the act of thinking takes place in the past. The English tense ("was _ing") makes the past-ness explicit. In my opinion, the trick here is: because the 考える is in the subordinate clause, its tense should be interpreted relative to the tense of the main clause. In this case, the "thinking" occurs in the present relative to when the "ending" happened (which means the "thinking" happened at the same time as the "ending"). Since the "ending" is in past tense, that means the "thinking" also happened in the past. If your brain is operating in Japanese then this might make sense. A different example:</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">その方程式を暗記したらテストを合格したはず</li>
<li class="tod">If I'd memorized that equation I probably would've passed that test.</li>
</ul>

<p>合格した is in simple past form despite the fact that no "passing" ever took place. In English we have to use a "would've" to mark the hypothetical status of this act. No further analysis should be necessary, though it's worth explicitly saying that Japanese completely lacks a direct equivalent to "would" because, as you can see, it simply doesn't need one.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="Compound Particles Revisited">Compound Particles Revisited</div>

<p>Some of the compound particles can be explained a little better once you understand clause-ending nouns. Basically, I think の can be short for 事 koto or もの mono, especially if in a compound particle.</p>

<p>To convince you this works, let's bring in some old examples:</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">読むとすぐに眠るの（こと）は何故</li>
<li class="tod">Why is it that you fall asleep right away when reading something?</li>
</ul>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">また変なの（もの）が来たみたい</li>
<li class="tod">Looks like another weird thing came.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">二ヶ月書くの（こと）が危険だけど一つの名作くらい書きたい</li>
<li class="tod">It's dangerous writing for two months straight, but I wanna write at least one masterpiece.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">そんなに綺麗なの（もの）か？</li>
<li class="tod">Is it that pretty?</li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly, に in a compound particle may loosely resemble 場合 ba'ai or 所 tokoro.</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">私に（の場合で）は蛇が恐ろしい</li>
<li class="tod">For me, snakes are terrifying.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">科学に（のところ）は詳しい人の方が好ましい</li>
<li class="tod">In science, the knowledgeable person is more desirable.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are probably the most useful comparisons, but I think most compound particles can be explained (at least in some of their uses) in a similar way if desired.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="Hard Examples">Hard Examples</div>

<p>And now, just for good measure, some examples of painfully long sentences. Because long multi-clause sentences normally only occur deep in context, natural-sounding examples aren't really possible, so I had fun stretching these out until they got ridiculous.</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">週末に宿題を終わせる気だったけどテニス部から期待してる友達が来て、断ることをできなくて、一瞬だけが残ったくせにみんなと遊んでいたわけだと？</li>
<li class="tod">You say the reason was that even though you intended to finish your homework by the end of the week, expectant friends from the tennis club came, you were unable to refuse, and you played with all of them even though there was only one week remaining?</li>
</ul>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">バカのせいで助けたことはがっかりだが話してる場合じゃないから見つかれてないうちに早く脱出するほうが私達と基地で待っている仲間には最善であるはず</li>
<li class="tod">The fact that we were saved thanks to the idiot is depressing but, since this is no time for talking, the best option for us and our comrades waiting at the base should be to escape faster while they still haven't found us.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">店に行ったときには彼女に興味がないふりをしたけどリンゴを選んでるところで声をかけられて、そのおかげでするべきやずっとするつもりだったことをほとんどできた</li>
<li class="tod">When I went to the store I pretended not to be interested in her, but I was spoken to (by her) while picking out apples, and thanks to that I was able to do most of the things I should have and had always planned on doing.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">祖父と住んでいる頃、電力を使いすぎないように電池を切るよりついたままでいいかどうかを良く考えましたって今思えば幼い私には恐ろしいほど影響があったかすごい甲斐があったか</li>
<li class="tod">Back when I was living with my grandfather, I often thought about whether it was better, in order to not use too much power, to leave the lights on rather than turn them off.  Thinking about it now, did that have a frightening degree of influence on or was it just incredibly worthwhile for my young self?</li>
</ul>

<p>This section teaches almost nothing about Japanese grammar.  Instead, the goal is to quickly introduce you to some basic grammar terms I need to use in the guide in order to explain how Japanese works.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<h4 id="General Terms">General Terms</h4>

<p><strong>Phrase</strong>: two or more consecutive words which can be treated as a single unit.</p>

<p><strong>Subject</strong>: the word or phrase expressing whatever is performing the action</p>

<p><strong>Predicate</strong>: the word or phrase expressing whatever action is being performed</p>

<p><strong>Object:</strong> a word or phrase expressing whatever is being acted upon</p>

<p><strong>Clause</strong>: a phrase which has both a subject and a predicate. May or may not be a complete sentence.</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">Example:</li>
<li class="tod">"My cats like to meow loudly at people."</li>
<li class="tod">Subject:</li>
<li class="tod">"My cats"  Predicate: "like to meow loudly"  Object: "at people"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Lexical Word</strong>: Any word that represents a concept or has a meaning all by itself. Most words in a language are lexical, and they are collectively called a language's <strong>lexicon</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Particle</strong>: Any non-lexical word, i.e. a word that has no meaning on its own but is only used for grammatical reasons. In English, these are mostly prepositions and pronouns.  Exactly what does and does not count as a particle is very debatable.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<h4 id="Basic Parts of Speech">Basic Parts of Speech</h4>

<p><strong>Part of Speech (POS)</strong> or <strong>Lexical Category</strong>: Any term or category used to define what grammatical roles words are capable of fulfilling. The eight generally recognized English parts of speech are: nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions and interjections.</p>

<p><strong>Noun</strong>: a word denoting a person, place, thing, idea or feeling</p>

<p><strong>Pronoun</strong>: a word which acts as shorthand for one or more nouns, usually in order to avoid repeating the noun/listing all the nouns {I, you, he, she, it, they, everyone, someone, each, every}</p>

<p><strong>Verb</strong>: a word denoting an action</p>

<p><strong>Adjective (adj.)</strong>: any word that describes or modifies a noun</p>

<p><strong>Adverb (adv.)</strong>: any word that describes or modifies a verb, adjective, or other adverb.  You may have been told all adverbs end in -ly. That's not true.</p>

<p><strong>Adposition (adp.)</strong>: a word used to attach extra objects to a sentence. All English adpositions are prepositions (they're placed before their objects) while all Japanese adpositions are postpositions (they're placed after their objects).</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">Example:</li>
<li class="tod">"I think entertaining music contributes significantly to a video game."</li>
</ul>

<p>Here "music" and "video game" are nouns, "I" is a pronoun (acting as shorthand for the speaker's name), "think" and "contributes" are verbs, "entertaining" is an adjective describing the noun "music", and "significantly" is an adverb describing the verb "contributes".</p>

<p>Finally, "to" is a preposition attaching the object "video game" to "contributes" (notice that the sentence would still make sense without "to a video game", hence this object is optional and a preposition is needed to attach it).</p>

<p><strong>Conjunction</strong>: a word(s) that connects two clauses and/or describes the relationship between them {and, but, if, yet, so, for}</p>

<p><strong>Interjection</strong>: a word or short phrase that isn't really part of a sentence, but instead is used as a quick exclamation {ow!, hey!, oh my god!} or as a space filler {um, uh, er…}</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<h4 id="Inflection">Inflection</h4>

<p><strong>Inflection</strong>: modifying a word to change or add to its original meaning. A word with no inflection whatsoever is called a <strong>lemma</strong>, and the set of words which can be created by inflecting it are called a <strong>lexeme</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Pluralization</strong>: the process of changing a singular noun or pronoun {cat, I} into a plural one {cats, we}. This is probably the simplest and most intuitive type of inflection in English.</p>

<p><strong>Declension</strong>:  the process of changing <em>nouns, pronouns and/or adjectives</em> to incorporate concepts such as tense, person, and mood. English doesn't do this at all, but Japanese does for adjectives.</p>

<p><strong>Conjugation</strong>: the process of changing <em>verbs</em> to incorporate concepts such as tense, person, and mood.  This can be done either by changing the verb's ending or by adding a helping verb.</p>

<p><strong>Stem</strong>: the portion of a verb that normally remains unchanged by inflection/conjugation.</p>

<p><strong>Helping Verb/Auxiliary Verb</strong>: a word placed in front of the main verb in order to conjugate it.  {be, have, should, must, can, might}  Japanese has none of these, and instead allows the verb's ending to be changed in several ways at once.</p>

<p><strong>Tense</strong>: the time(s), or period(s) of time during which an action occurs.  English and Japanese use most of the same tenses, though they express them differently.</p>

<p><strong>Person</strong>: the type of subject performing the action.  In English, it states only the subject's relative position to the speaker.  Japanese never inflects for person.</p>

<p><strong>Mood</strong>: the intent or nature of emotion involved in the statement.  Includes concepts like commands, requests, probability, necessity, conditional statements and hypothetical speaking.  English moods usually involve helping verbs. Japanese moods are expressed with verb forms and "sentence ending particles".</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">Example:</li>
<li class="tod">"If I had defeated him, that wouldn't have happened."</li>
</ul>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">Tense:</li>
<li class="tod">past perfect tense (happened only in the past)  Person: 1st person (the actor is the speaker)  Mood: conditional (if _, then _)</li>
</ul>

<p>I refer to Tenses, Persons and Moods collectively as <strong>Verb Forms</strong>.  When describing Japanese, I rarely find it necessary to explicitly distinguish between the three, so <a class="underscore" href="#Conjugation">Conjugation</a> just uses the term "forms" constantly.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<h4 id="Other Important Terms">Other Important Terms</h4>

<p>For some reason, these terms come up a lot when explaining differences between English and Japanese.</p>

<p><strong>Phrasal Verb</strong>: a specific verb and adposition which, when used together, have a unique meaning.  English has a lot of these (to write up, to work through, to fight on, etc).  Japanese has a few.</p>

<p><strong>Transitivity</strong>: The minimum number of objects a verb needs in order to make grammatical sense.  A verb requiring 0 objects is called intransitive (e.g., to run), a verb requiring 1 is called <strong>transitive</strong> (e.g., to say something), and a verb requiring 2 is called <strong>ditransitive</strong> (e.g., to give someone something).  Adpositions are used to add objects which aren't grammatically necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Demonstratives</strong>: words like "this" and "that" which can be pronouns or adjectives (compare "this is blue" to "this flower is blue").  Japanese always uses two separate words, which may be tricky to grasp at first.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<h4 id="Other Interesting Terms">Other Interesting Terms</h4>

<p>I won't expect you to know any of these since I rarely use them myself (except for a few of the tenses, which I redefine when they come up later), but it's probably good to have heard of them at least once.</p>

<p><strong>Concrete Noun</strong>: a word defining a person, place, or thing {America, road, human}</p>

<p><strong>Abstract Noun</strong>: a word defining an idea or feeling {psyche, concept, morbidity}</p>

<p><strong>Articles</strong>: the words "the," "an," and "a."  These are considered adjectives.</p>

<p><strong>Comparative Adjectives</strong>: adjectives used to contrast two nouns or noun phrases.  In English, these are formed with the adverb "more" or the suffix "-er."  Japanese uses ほう and より.</p>

<p><strong>Superlative Adjectives</strong>: adjectives used to contrast one noun with ‘everything else.’  In English, these are formed with the adverb "most" or the suffix "-est."  Japanese uses もっとも and 一番.</p>

<p><strong>1st person</strong>: a grammatical person in which the speaker is the subject {I, me}</p>

<p><strong>2nd person</strong>: a person in which the speaker is talking to the subject {you, yours}</p>

<p><strong>3rd person</strong>: a person in which the speaker is talking about but not to the subject {he, she, it}</p>

<p><strong>Correlative Conjunction</strong>: two or more words that surround the phrase(s) they conjunct. {if…then, both…and, either…or, neither…nor, not only…but…also/too}</p>

<p><strong>Personal Pronouns</strong>: pronouns that take the place of a specific noun and serve no secondary grammatical purpose.  {I, me, you, he/she, it, we, they, that, those, this, these}</p>

<p><strong>Relative Pronouns</strong>: pronouns referring to a previous noun within the same sentence, thereby denoting a subordinate clause.  {These events <em>which</em> you were involved in…}</p>

<p><strong>Interrogative Pronouns</strong>: pronouns that ask a question.  {who, what, when, where, why}</p>

<p><strong>Indefinite Pronouns</strong>: pronouns that represent general categories of people or things.  {everyone, everything, someone, something, anyone, anything}</p>

<p><strong>Reflexive Pronouns</strong>: effectively what personal pronouns look like when "reused" later in the same sentence.  {myself, yourself, themselves}</p>

<p><strong>Distributive Pronouns</strong>: pronouns that represent one item or person in a group separately from the others.  {each, every, the other}</p>

<p><strong>Negative Pronouns</strong>: pronouns specifying an indefinite noun that is absent from a certain group.  {none, nobody, nothing}</p>

<p><strong>Generic mood</strong>: used to make very general statements about a particular class of things</p>

<p><strong>Declarative or Indicative mood</strong>: a simple statement of fact, without any special qualifications or implications.  Considered the "default" mood in all languages.</p>

<p><strong>Conditional mood</strong>: used to speak of an event whose realization is dependent on a certain condition (i.e., hypothetical and ‘if, then’ statements).</p>

<p><strong>Imperative mood</strong>: expresses direct commands, requests, and other impositions of will.</p>

<p><strong>Interrogative mood</strong>: used for asking questions ("do you" instead of "you do").</p>

<p><strong>Negative mood</strong>: expresses a negated action.  English negations use the auxiliary "not."</p>

<p><strong>Potential mood</strong>: a mood of probability, indicating that in the opinion of the speaker, the action or occurrence is considered likely.</p>

<p><strong>Infinitive</strong>: the default or dictionary verb form.  In English, it’s "to run," "to be," etc., although the "to" in front is optional.</p>

<p><strong>Gerund</strong>: a verb form used as a noun meaning "the action of _ing."  For example, "skiing, walking, typing, conjugating, etc."  Obviously, English gerunds use the -ing form.</p>

<p><strong>Participle</strong>: a verb form that only specifies one grammatical detail (present or past tense), while shifting the designation of other details onto an auxiliary verb, thereby allowing for more complex tenses.</p>

<p><strong>Present Participle</strong>: the –ing form with an auxiliary.  Used in passive voice and complex tenses.  "I am <em>being</em> watched."  "I will be <em>watching</em> it when…"</p>

<p><strong>Past Participle</strong>: the –ed form with an auxiliary.  Used in passive voice and complex tenses.        "I was <em>defeated</em>."  "I had <em>arrived</em> there when…"</p>

<p><strong>Active Voice</strong>: as usual, the subject is the one performing the action.</p>

<p><strong>Passive Voice</strong>: instead the action is being done to the subject, not by it.  "I was defeated."</p>

<p><strong>Simple Present Tense</strong>: an action taking place in the present.  "I go to school."  In all languages I know, this is also the infinitive.</p>

<p><strong>Simple Past Tense</strong>: an action taking place in the past.  "I went to class."</p>

<p><strong>Simple Future Tense</strong>: an action taking place in the future.  "I will go home."</p>

<p>In the Introduction I cite "several precise but abstract words English lacks" as one of Japanese's major pros.  Unfortunately, the flip side of this is that Japanese to English dictionaries are often terrible at defining and unable to adequately explain these words.  So, I wanted to make a list of the ones I know are likely to cause you problems sooner or later.  While I was at it, I also added a few which are just grammatical oddities, frequently mistranslated or poorly adapted, or otherwise need some kind of clarification.

<div class="guideheading" id="付く">付く</div>

<p>There are a lot of different "tsuku"s out there written with different kanji, but like most homonyms a decent dictionary is all you really need.  This one is special because it is so vague and so common.  Most literally, it means "to attach."  Very few uses are markedly more popular than the countless others, so here are those few plus a bunch of random ones:</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">顔に付く</li>
<li class="tod">= to attach to the face = to be on/stuck to one's face</li>
<li class="tod">名前を付く</li>
<li class="tod">= to attach a name to <em>something</em> = to give something a name/to decide on a name</li>
<li class="tod">近付く= 近く付く</li>
<li class="tod">= to attach <em>oneself</em> to the vicinity of = to approach/get close to</li>
<li class="tod">気付く= 気が付く</li>
<li class="tod">= <em>one's</em> spirit attach = to realize/notice <em>something</em> (see <a class="underscore" href="#気 ki idioms">気 ki idioms</a>)</li>
<li class="tod">嘘を付く</li>
<li class="tod">= to attach a lie = to lie <em>about something</em></li>
<li class="tod">思い付く</li>
<li class="tod">= to think and attach = to attach <em>one's</em> thoughts to = to think of/hit upon <em>something</em></li>
<li class="tod">凍り付く</li>
<li class="tod">= to freeze and attach = to be frozen/stuck <em>to something</em></em></li>
<li class="tod">火が付く</li>
<li class="tod">= fire attaches <em>to something</em> = <em>something</em> catches fire</li>
<li class="tod">元気付く= 元気を付く</li>
<li class="tod">= to attach liveliness/energy = to become cheerful/get well again</li>
</ul>

<p>This is an excellent of something you probably don't "get" yet, and will only "get" once you've been working with Japanese for a very long time.  Hopefully this saves you at least a little frustration.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="加減">加減</div>

<p>Literally "degree" (just like 程 hodo), though it's virtually never used to mean that.  Its current usage is always in the phrase いい加減 which is literally "good degree" or "moderation."  This can mean exactly what it looks like in the typical line いい加減にしなさい "do it in moderation" i.e. "stop overdoing _" or "do less of _" which is often used much like the English "cut it out already." </p>

<p>But just to be incredibly annoying, いい加減な＿ always means "a _ lacking in moderation" despite there being absolutely nothing to even imply a negative in that phrase.  I can't really explain this at all except by pointing out that English has some equally perplexing flip-flops (see "bad boy," "goody two-shoes," any vulgar interjection, etc.). </p>

<p>It's also common to use いい加減 like an adverb to imply the action is long overdue, usually in tandem with a <a class="underscore" href="#Modal%20Implications%20of%20Conditional%20Forms">modal implication</a> or <a class="underscore" href="#どう dou Phrases">どう</a> phrase. For instance, いい加減逃げれば？ would usually mean "Shouldn't you just (give up and) run away already?"</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="折角">折角</div>

<p>Literally something like "circumstances conducive to doing _."  Depending on context, translations (once an obligatory だから or なので or something is added) may include "since/while we're all here," "given the circumstances," "might as well," etc.  Note that this is always used when leading into an additional activity on top of whatever the speaker et. al. are already doing or planning on doing.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="適当">適当</div>

<p>Most literally, "appropriate."  Sometimes that means what it looks like.  But when used to mean "appropriate to the immediate situation," then it confuses the hell out of English speakers.</p>

<p>In that case, it describes something which is "based on gut feelings/instincts/snap judgments rather than genuine thought/consideration/analysis."  In a comedic sense it means improvisation, ad libbing or lying to be funny, but in a more serious sense it can also mean saying something you don't really mean.  The latter is the harder to understand, so to give an example: a girl you have no interest in asks you out, but because you don't want to make her cry you (適当に) agree to go out with her anyway, regardless of the fact that this will just make her cry more later when you two break up.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="仕方ない">仕方ない</div>

<p>Also 仕方がない, しようがない, and しょうがない.  These all literally mean "there is no way/means <em>of preventing/fixing something.</em>"  The most accurate adaptation might be "it can't be helped," "there's no choice," "there's no other way," "we can't do anything about it," and so on depending on context.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="させてもらう">させてもらう</div>

<p>This is the -te morau form of the causative form, both of which you should be familiar with.  What makes this weird is that "to have you let me _" not only rarely makes any sense but actually means something like "to do _ despite not asking/knowing/caring if you're okay with it."  Sometimes this can be adapted with a phrase like "I'll have to use your _" or "I'll just let myself _" or "I'll take the liberty of _", but sometimes it's just dropped.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="っていうか">っていうか</div>

<p>Technically this is a compound particle, but it's harder to explain than most, so it didn't really fit into <a class="underscore" href="#Compound%20Particles">Compound Particles</a>.  The only real good way to explain it is through an (underlined) example like this:</p>

<ul class="tod">Japanese: 
<li class="tod">読みが遅かったって言うか、よく解らなかった</li>
</ul>
<ul class="tod">Hyperliteral: 
<li class="tod">"<em>Would I say</em> my reading was slow<em>?</em> I didn't really understand it."</li>
</ul>
<ul class="tod">Literal: 
<li class="tod">"<em>I guess you could say</em> I was reading slowly, <em>but it's better to say</em> I didn't really understand it."</li>
</ul>

<p>At least, that's how I interpret it literally, since using "say" that way helps establish the connection to what っていう normally means.  You may also see this shortened to something like てか or つか.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="贅沢">贅沢</div>

<p>Literally, this means "luxury". Most of the time, it's used to refer to someone wishing/asking/hoping for something they could never realistically obtain/achieve, especially if what they already have obtained/achieved should be more than enough to satisfy them. For instance, if your soccer team spends years training hard to beat a rival team, and you finally manage to defeat them 3-1, and you're mumbling to yourself about how you shouldn't have let them score a single goal, that's an extreme case of 贅沢.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="割り切る">割り切る</div>

<p>Most literally, "to divide by cutting", i.e. cut a part out of a whole. When meant concretely, this is as easy as it looks. Abstractly, it's more like "to cut off one's emotions from an event or decision". Cutting emotions off an event means something like "getting over", "getting past" or "moving on from" that event. Cutting emotions off from a decision means not letting your emotions get in the way of making the right choice. If portrayed positively, this often means being "decisive", but if portrayed negatively, this often means being "cold" or "calculating".</p>

<p>Incidentally, the use of this word assumes the person "has emotions" to cut off in the first place. If someone who simply doesn't care about human life chooses to sacrifice people for some noble cause, that's not 割り切り no matter how right the decision was.</p>

<p>MuvLuv Alternative has a <em>lot</em> of good examples of this word. For instance, when one character angrily asks whether they should simply abandon their "Storm Vanguard" and focus on the mission if he gets separated from the rest of the squad, another says "well yeah, that's the risk of being in that position", and the protagonist is impressed by her 割り切り.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="かかる">かかる</div>

<p>This is one of those verbs that has such a ridiculous vairety of disparate <a class="underscore" href="https://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/jn/37972/meaning/m0u/">meanings</a> that attempting to list or learn them all is probably a waste of time. So here is a very short list of the meanings I think are actually worth memorizing, either because they're very common, or they're the ones least likely to be conveniently implied by nearby nouns. </p>

<ul>
<li>to hang/be suspended from/over/across</li>
<li>to take time/cost money</li>
<li>to get caught on something</li>
<li>to fall for/into a trap</li>
<li>(a device) to be activated/running/engaged</li>
</ul>

<div class="guideheading" id="先 saki vs 元 moto">先 saki vs 元 moto</div>

<p>These two kanji have several meanings, but they're always opposites of each other.  Every meaning of one is the opposite of one of the other's.  The best generalized definition I can come up with is that 元 moto is "point A" and 先 saki is "point B" along some literal or figurative line.  Specific cases include:</p>


<ul class="tod">1) The line is time:</li>
<li class="tod">元 means original, origin, or former</li>
<li class="tod">先 means future, result or progression</li>
</ul>

<ul class="tod">2) The line is a plan or procedure:</li>
<li class="tod">元 means beginning or start</li>
<li class="tod">先 means destination, objective or what comes next</li>
</ul>

<ul class="tod">3) The line goes from the rear to the front of an object or along a physical path:</li>
<li class="tod">元 means base, source or root</li>
<li class="tod">先 means tip, head or end</li>
</ul>

<ul class="tod">4) The line defines a direction someone/something is looking or pointing:</li>
<li class="tod">先 means the direction/area/object they're/it's indicating</li>
</ul>

<ul class="tod">The weird one: 先 can also mean "just now."</li>
<li class="tod">This is the one that's really hard to work into a general definition, but it's at least (barely) possible to reconcile this with mine by combining cases 1 and 3 and saying that the "tip" of the "timeline" is the most recent event on it.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="ちゃんと chanto and 一応 ichiou">ちゃんと chanto and 一応 ichiou</div>

<p>I believe ちゃんと chanto most literally means "like you're supposed to."  Possible adaptations may use phrases like "doing it right," "properly," "as expected," "correctly," "without any huge mistakes," etc.</p>

<p>一応 ichiou is pretty much the negation of that, so it roughly means "not exactly like you were expected/supposed to do it," though for some reason it's more difficult.  Depending on the context, the precise meaning may be more like "technically," "kind of," "in a way/sense," "despite evidence to contrary," "I know what it looks like," etc.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="余裕 yoyuu, 容赦 yousha and 余地 yochi">余裕 yoyuu, 容赦 yousha and 余地 yochi</div>

<p>The best general definition for 余裕 yoyuu is, "more of something than is absolutely necessary."  That something can be food, money, time, room, space, stamina, brainpower, options, resources, etc, and it's often more than one of those things.  The word can also refer to the attitude that results from having this excess, namely a sense of pride, superiority, overconfidence, or a disposition to bide one's time, enjoy it to the fullest, and/or rub it in people's faces.</p>

<p>On the other hand, 容赦 yousha is basically 余裕 yoyuu given to you by some other animate party.  容赦 yousha itself may translate to leniency, mercy, tolerance, forgiveness, etc.  To clarify: in a context where 余裕が無い means "you'll have no second chances," 容赦がない might mean "I'm not giving you any second chances."</p>

<p>余地 yochi is essentially 余裕 yoyuu but without the subjective/psychological meanings. So 余地 yochi can refer to money, time, room, space, options, resources, etc. but not to stamina, brainpower, pride, superiority, overconfidence. For some reason, 余地 yochi is particularly popular when referring to a sort of logical space of possibilities. For instance, when a certain claim is completely ruled out by hard evidence, we say there is no longer any 余地 yochi left for that claim to "exist" in.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id=調子 choushi and 様子 yousu"">調子 choushi and 様子 yousu</div>

<p>Both of these words basically mean "how one is/things are doing."  調子 choushi is more likely to refer to a change/trend over time, while 様子 yousu is more likely to refer to the immediate state of affairs.  As a result, 調子 choushi can translate to way, trend, manner, progression, state of health, while 様子 yousu can translate to appearance, state, situation, etc.  This is not as easy to learn as I make it sound.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="漫才 manzai (突っ込む tsukkomu and ボケる bokeru)">漫才 manzai (突っ込む tsukkomu and ボケる bokeru)</div>

<p>Often defined as "comic dialogue," though it specifically refers to what in English is called a "double act."  That means a stand-up comedy duo with a ボケ boke (or "funny man," who acts stupid) and a 突っ込み tsukkomi (or "straight man," who comments on the stupidity).  The double act itself is important only because it is insanely common in Japanese pop culture (interestingly, the protagonist/narrator is almost always the 突っ込み tsukkomi) and because the words for the two parts of it are verbs which are very hard to explain outside of this context.</p>

<p>ボケる bokeru literally means "to grow senile," so you can pretend this means "to have a senior moment" to explain why it more often means "to do something inexplicably and comically stupid."</p>

<p>突っ込む tsukkomu literally means "to thrust/plunge into something" or "to stab/jab at something."  It is not too hard to explain its colloquial usage as "to stab/attack the gaps in someone's reasoning/behavior."  This is the more common of the two verbs, and usually much harder to adapt well, so here are a few options: to attack, to criticize, to counter-argue, to point out problems, to burst someone's bubble.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="通じる tsuujiru and 伝わる tsutawaru">通じる tsuujiru and 伝わる tsutawaru</div>

<p>Both of these words share a meaning best defined as "to convey/get across."  伝わる tsutawaru usually has a subjective object, i.e. to convey a feeling, emotion or idea.  通じる tsuujiru usually takes something more objective, i.e. to convey an idea, plan, message.  The repetition of "idea" is intentional, since that roughly describes where the two words overlap.  伝わる tsutawaru can also mean to circulate or pass down.  通じる tsuujiru can also mean to have in common or to make sense.</p>

<div class="guideheading" id="挨拶 aisatsu">挨拶 aisatsu</div>

<p>This is often defined just as "greeting" or "farewell", but in reality it means "ritual phrase", which includes certain greetings and farewells, plus some other stuff. Admittedly, it is often fine to translate it as "greeting", but don't forget what it really means.  There's a <a class="underscore" href="#Some Ritual Phrases">short list</a> of ritual phrases farther down.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="聞く kiku">聞く kiku</div>

<p>Means either "to hear/listen" or "to ask."  It always means one of the two, never both, and you have no way of knowing which except for the fact that only one of them will make any sense.  Some writers will use this kanji trick to help clarify: 聴く kiku usually means "to listen" and 訊く kiku usually means "to ask."</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="いる iru and ある aru">いる iru and ある aru</div>

<p>By now you probably know of 居る iru as in "to be," which is an ichidan verb.  There's also 要る iru as in "to be needed," which is a godan verb.  要る is only ever used in its infinitive and negative forms, so remember that いらない is "to be unnecessary" while いない is "to not be."</p>

<p>There's also 入る for "to enter" (though it's usually in set phrases or read as hairu instead), 射る for "to shoot with an arrow" (context should make it exceedingly obvious when this is being used) and three or four other kanji for "to fry/boil/roast" (again, context), but it's mostly the top two you need to keep in mind.</p>

<p>As for ある aru, there's a popular myth that いる iru is for animate objects and ある aru for inanimate (I think some textbooks are to blame).  While there is a tendency for this to be the case, the real distinction is that いる iru is the default word for "to be" while ある aru is an alternative slightly closer to "to exist", and there simply is no hard rule to tell which one is "correct." Much of the time both are valid, even if one is slightly more natural.  It's kinda similar to the は vs. が problem.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="知る shiru">知る shiru</div>

<p>You probably already recognize this word as "to know" or something similar.  However, dictionaries all seem to omit the alternate meaning "to care."  This meaning is almost always used in one of two ways:</p>

<ul class="tod">知るか can be 
<li class="tod">"do I know?"
<li class="tod">but is often a masculine way of saying "do I care?" or "how would I know?"
</ul>

<ul class="tod">知らない can be
<li class="tod">"I don't know" but is often a feminine way of saying "I don't care!"
<li class="tod">but is often a feminine way of saying "I don't care!"
</ul>

<p>Also, this seems to be exclusive to when the speaker is angry, so you could easily argue it doesn't count as a separate definition but just an idiomatic usage.  Just to be clear: in most contexts "to care" is handled by 構う kamau instead.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="いい ii and 悪い warui">いい ii and 悪い warui</div>

<p>You probably know that these mean "good/fine/okay" and "bad". What you might not have known is that some of the alternate meanings/uses those words have in English also apply to their Japanese counterparts. First, in English "I'm fine" or "It's okay" can be a polite way of saying "I don't want/need that". The same is true of いいよ and similar phrases (as well as stuff like 結構です). Second, in English the slang "my bad" can be used for "sorry", and 悪い happens to do the same thing in Japanese. But 悪い goes even farther, and crosses over into sentences where English speakers would normally say "thank you" rather than "sorry".</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="済む sumu">済む sumu</div>

<p>Literally "to end/finish/complete," and technically that's all it ever means.  The reason it's worth mentioning here is because whenever you say "to end without _ing" in Japanese you  might actually mean "to not have to _."  For example, この事件を殺さずに済ませる is literally "to make this incident end without killing" and likely means "to end this incident without having to kill."  Both translations are about equally valid in this example, though there will be times when only one of the two makes any sense.</p>

<div class="guideheading" id="世話 sewa">世話 sewa</div>

<p>世話 is literally "help," "assistance," or "looking after."  The reason this deserves a mention here is the popular phrase 世話になる or "to be/become someone who is looked after."  Notice the passive voice coming from (apparently) nowhere.  What this phrase really means is "to impose upon someone," and some form of it is almost invariably said whenever someone feels they are obliged to someone else.  This is sometimes best translated using "thank you" or "I appreciate what you've done for _."</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="迷惑 meiwaku">迷惑 meiwaku</div>

<p>The converse (?) of 世話になる is 迷惑をかける.  While the former means having someone else help you with your problems, the latter means to cause problems for someone else.  Aside from the literal (which is often accurate), it is sometimes best to translate this using "I'm sorry" or "I apologize for what I've done to _."</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="面倒 mendou">面倒 mendou</div>

<p>面倒を見る means "to look after/take care of someone."  This one can pretty much always be translated literally, but I'm mentioning it for completeness' sake, and because other uses of 面倒 are hard to explain without knowing this phrase.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="困る komaru">困る komaru</div>

<p>Simply "to be troubled."  This refers to any sort of emotional discomfort/malaise/puzzlement as well as actually having a problem that needs solving.  Forms of 困る komaru (especially causative) can behave a lot like the phrases above, but can often be translated literally, e.g. 人を困らせるな "don't trouble people."</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="勝手 katte">勝手 katte</div>

<p>It can be as simple as "selfish," though it often refers to specific selfish actions which either directly disobey someone else's will or are done with blatant indifference toward someone else's will.  Hence it should often be adapted using "without" and an additional verb based on what action would have negated the selfishness, e.g. 勝手に出るな might be "Don't leave without telling/asking me."</p>

<h4 id="Words with odd grammatical behavior">Words with odd grammatical behavior</h4>

<div class="guideheading">好き suki and 嫌い kirai</div>

<p>The words themselves are effortless, but grammatically speaking they behave very oddly.  They're both -i forms of the verbs 好く and 嫌う, but at the same time they seem to be -na adjectives, since it's perfectly normal to see 好きじゃない, 嫌いだった, etc.  Fortunately, other forms of the verbs are normal.</p>

<p>気 ki literally means "spirit" or "air."  You may be more familiar with it as the Chinese word 気 qi or the martial arts concept of ki/qi/chi/life energy/whatever flowing through your body, which is actually a very good image to help you understand the word in Japanese.</p>

<p>There are dozens of common, standardized and idiomatic phrases using this word; probably more than any other word in the language has.  It's certainly the hardest list of expressions for a Westerner to master (see <a class="underscore" href="http://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/leaf/je2/15273/m1u/気/">this entry</a> for a very thorough list), which is why I want to list some literal meanings and equivalent English phrases here for the most common ones. Also, I believe that checking how much of this list makes intuitive sense to you is a good way of gauging how far you're getting with your Japanese overall.</p>

<div class="guideheading" id="Deceitful Loanwords">Deceitful Loanwords</div>

<p>Kind of a random topic, but definitely worth mentioning.  By now you've noticed that Japanese has a lot of loanwords from English, that they are usually written in katakana, and that they pretty much mean the same thing they did in our language, although they may exclude or add an alternate meaning.</p>

<p>There are also some loanwords whose usage bears little or no resemblance whatsoever to English.  It's easy to get confused by them, especially if your dictionary chooses to be misleading and just throw the English word back at you.</p>

<p>A few good examples:</p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">テンション</li>
<li class="tod">tension refers to a person's attentiveness/reactiveness/perkiness/energy level</li>
<li class="tod">メール</li>
<li class="tod">mail always refers to e-mail or text messaging, never physical mail</li>
<li class="tod">マンション</li>
<li class="tod">mansion actually refers to a large apartment complex</li>
<li class="tod">ピンチ</li>
<li class="tod">pinch always refers to the state of being "in a pinch" or "in trouble," never the physical act of pinchi</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="Love Words">Love Words</div>

<p>Japanese has a lot of them.  I would like to list a few.</p>

<p>恋 koi and 愛 ai both mean romantic love, but they make a distinction English often leaves implied.  恋 koi tends to mean short-term, shallow, infatuated love, while 愛 ai tends to mean long-term, deep, married couple-type love.  It's common for this distinction to be explicitly mentioned (恋じゃなくて愛だ), so you need to understand it.</p>

<p>恋愛 ren'ai is the general term for love, encompassing both 恋koi and 愛 ai (as you can tell from the kanji) and sometimes even more kinds.  You usually use this word when talking about the concept of love itself rather than any specific instance of one person falling for another.</p>

<p>好き suki, gerund of 好く suku, refers to liking/loving someone.  You may recall the word "to like" in English has a certain ambiguity as to whether it means friendship, love between family, or actual romantic love.  好き suki has it too.  嫌い kirai is its opposite, meaning disliking/hating someone.</p>

<p>憧れる akogareru and 惚れる horeru both mean "to be attracted to/by _," and, interestingly enough, seem to imply that the emotion (romantic or otherwise) is caused by how the other person acts/behaves.</p>

<p>憧れる akogareru is more likely to mean "to admire/look up to" or "to have a crush on" than actual love, while 惚れる horeru is more likely to mean "to fall in love with/be charmed by."  It's probably worth mentioning that 一目惚れ hitomebore is how the Japanese say "love at first sight."</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="どう dou Phrases">どう dou Phrases</div>

<p>Not many of them, and none are particularly hard, but they're so incredibly common it's worth trying to explain them instead of simply listing meanings like with the 気 idioms.</p>

<ul>1) どうでもいい </ul>
<p>= "however (it turns out), good" = "good no matter what" = "it doesn't matter how".  It can almost always be translated with some form of "doesn't matter."  But to help it make more sense, imagine whatever came before it ended with ＿は (which it often does) so that you get "In the context of _, no matter what, it's fine" i.e. "it's fine no matter what happens to _/how _ works out."</p>

<ul>2) どうすればいい</ul>
<p>= "if I do how, good?" = "It would be good if I did what?" = "What should I do?"  Again, often best assumed to have a ＿は so that it becomes "it would be good if I did what about _/in the context of _/when _ comes up" or "What should I do about _?"</p>

<ul>3) ＿てどうする</ul>
<p>is a particularly interesting usage of the conjunctive -te, literally meaning "_ and do what?" or "What would you do after _ing/accomplish by _ing?". Usually the intent is along the lines of "Why would you (want to) _?" or "What was the point in _ing?"</p>

<ul>4) ＿すればどう or ＿したらどう</ul>
<p>are literally "If/when you do/did _, what/how?" which if rearranged very slightly produces "How about you do _?" or "What if _ happens?", and these are pretty accurate definitions. However, the intent behind this is often closer to "Why not _?"</p>

<ul>5) どうせ</ul>
<p>acts like an adverb or transition, and is always at the beginning of a clause. The etymology is extremely similar to どうしても (since せ is an <a class="underscore" href="#The%20Jodoushi%20Model">old form</a> of する), but the intent of どうせ＿ is more like "(it doesn't matter anyway since) you're still going to _" or "_ is still true" or "_ will turn out to be true".</p>

<h4 id="Persistent 古語 kogo">Persistent 古語 kogo</h4>

<p>古語 kogo is a general term for old forms of Japanese, in contrast with modern Japanese. There's a supplemental <a class="underscore" href="#Old%20Japanese">section</a> all about it since, like many other languages, learning a little about old Japanese helps with understanding modern Japanese. This is partly because it helps explain a lot of the modern language's quirks, but also because most native speakers know a few things about old Japanese and are thus prone to using them even in otherwise modern Japanese. The goal here is to list those things, so you can avoid getting thrown off by them even if you don't care about learning old Japanese.</p>

<p>Before I can simply list all the bits worth knowing, there is one grammar detail that needs explaining. In old Japanese, instead of a single infinitive/nonpast form, there was a separate "predicative form" for verbs/adjectives meant to end a sentence, and an "attributive form" for verbs/adjectives at the end of a clause/phrase meant to describe a noun. The predicative form is the default/infinitive/dictionary form.</p>

<ul>
<li>All adjectives end in し in their predicative form, and either き or かる in their attributive form. Thus it's quite common to see adjectives ending in き for no apparent reason. This is also why ない can become なし or なき, and いい/よい can be よし. Adjectives also have a command form ending in -are, though so far なかれ is the only use of this I've seen in modern Japanese.</li>
<li>The old negative form is -a/-i -zu. Its attributive form is either -zaru or -nu, and its -i form is either -zari or -zu. That is pretty confusing, but all you need to remember is that -zu/-zari/-zaru/-nu are all old ways of indicating negation that modern speakeres may still use.</li>
<li>-zu is often used just like -nai, but it can also be used with the に particle in a way that's best translated using the word "without". </li>
<li>-zaru is mainly used in the expression ＿ざるを得ない meaning "unable to not _".</li>
<li>べき was originally the predicative form of べし. Its negative form is べからず. Also, in old Japanese べし meant a lot more than just "should/ought". Specifically, it indicates likelihood/volition/intent/obvious truth/recommendation/order/possibility. Again, when a modern speaker uses this it's usually very obvious which of these are intended, so don't let it scare you.</li>
<li>The <a class="underscore" href="#Why%20中古語%20Chuukogo">ancient</a> -a yu form (later replaced by -a ru and -i raru) is both a potential and a passive form. It's probably the origin of the modern words いわゆる (passive of "to say" → said to be → the so-called) and あらゆる (able to exist → all _s which can exit → various/many/all kinds).</li>
<li>The phrase 言わんばかり is the -a mu/n form (in this case, it's like a volitional form) plus the old ばかり (which means ほど or ぐらい). It's almost always correct to translate it as "as if to say".</li>
<li>The -i つつ form means "continue _ing", "repeatedly _" or "_ alongside/while _ing".</li>
<li>The old version of ば, both as a particle and as part of the -eba form, means "since/because" (like から). Nowadays it means "if".</li>
<li>ごとく means what らしい and みたい do nowadays.  However, like -i tsutsu, there are still some authors who use ごとく a lot.  You may also see its attributive form ごとき.</li>
<li>にて can mark place/time (like に), means/method (like で), someone's situation/status (like として), or a cause/reason (like から). Don't let the multiple meanings scare you, it's usually very obvious which is intended.</li>
<li>なり and たり are just old gobi.</li>
<li>のみ is pretty much identical to だけ.</li>
<li>だに means "if nothing else", "at the very least", "not even _ much less _".</li>
<li>As you may have noticed, modern Japanese has some confusing/redundant verbs such as 言わす and 合わす which seem to be just causative versions of 言う and 合う. The old causative form was in fact -asu instead of -aseru, so this redundancy is just the result of those verbs being so common their old causative forms had a lot of inertia.</li>
</ul>

<li>Past negative verbs now end in んかった or へんかった</li>
<li>ほんとう is replaced with ホンマ</li>
<li>いかん is replaced with あかん</li>
<li>いい is replaced with ええ</li>
<li>すごい/すごく is replaced with ごつい/ごっつ</li>
<li>The -i form (possibly with the i/e sound elongated) can be a soft/feminine command form</li>
<li>The -i form (possibly with the i/e sound elongated) followed by な can be a soft/feminine negative command form</li>
</ul>

<p>That should be enough to make sense out of any random Kansai you come across. There are of course dozens of other minor differences, but the ones listed above are among the most likely to throw you off or genuinely confuse you since they involve forms/particles/words you would never see otherwise.</p>

<p>The thickest, frequently-occuring Kansai dialect I've personally encountered in manga/anime/etc is that of Sket Dance's main heroine Himeko, so I would read some of that if for some reason you really want to learn basic Kansai.</p>

<p>This page is extremely incomplete and <strong>unreliable</strong> because I'm not yet capable of reading old Japanese. In fact, this is mostly here for my own sake. Putting together what I know into some guide-like form helps me retain and organize the knowledge better. But since it's not total crap, and you guys might learn something from this, I might as well upload it. </p>

<p>Pretty much all the information here comes directly from the books I've been using to study old Japanese, along with some "supplementary research" (browsing Japanese wikipedia articles) to fill in the details. One of the books is a ridiculously informative <a class="underscore" href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/旺文社古語辞典-松村-明/dp/4010721197">dictionary</a> for old Japanese, complete with grammar guide, and the other is an edition of the Tale of Genji which includes the original text, a modern translation and lots of translation notes. Just to be clear, neither book contains any English, which is part of the reason me translating and repackaging the information here might be of some use to someone. </p>

<p>This page is written on the assumption that you have little to no difficulty reading modern Japanese, or "Kinseigo", since I'll be defining things in terms of modern Japanese whenever it's convenient.</p>

<div class="guideheading" id="Why 中古語 Chuukogo">Why 中古語 Chuukogo?</div>

<p>The history of the Japanese language has four stages: </p>

<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">上代（じょうだい）日本語 - Old Japanese, </li>
<li class="tod">中古（ちゅうこ）日本語 - Early Middle Japanese, </li>
<li class="tod">中世（ちゅうせい）日本語 - Late Middle Japanese, </li>
<li class="tod">and of course 近世（きんせい）日本語 - Modern Japanese. </li>
</ul>

<p>To avoid any risk of ambiguity, I'll be referring to these as Joudaigo, Chuukogo, Chuuseigo and Kinseigo throughout this page. I'll use the adjectives "ancient" to imply Joudaigo, "old" to imply Chuukogo and "modern" to imply Kinseigo. Also, anything on this page marked with an asterisk (*) is unique to Joudaigo. 
Also, up until recently, Japanese had a literary form called 文語（ぶんご） which was separate from the spoken form, or 口語（こうご）.</p>

<p>This page is primarily about Chuukogo, for various reasons. First, 文語 is extremely similar to Chuukogo, so many modern-day Japanese speakers still have some familiarity with features of Chuukogo, which causes them to pop up in otherwise modern Japanese every so often.</p>

<p>Second, Japanese literature took off in the Heian period, when Chuukogo was being used, so most classics of Japanese fiction are written in Chuukogo (like the Tale of Genji) or Chuuseigo (like the Tale of Heike), which is much closer to Chuukogo than the others. For comparison, the most famous works written in Joudaigo are the Kojiki (mythology), Nihon Shoki (history) and Man'youshuu (poetry).</p>

<p>Third, to oversimplify things a bit, Joudaigo relied on a system of phonetic kanji called man'yougana, which was later used to develop the kana we're familiar with (in fact, man'yougana means "the kana used by the man'youshuu"). So even if you're more interested in Joudaigo, it seems like it might be better to learn Chuukogo (or maybe Chinese?) first and then transition to Joudaigo.</p>

<div class="guideheading" id="What Has and Hasnt Changed">What Has and Hasn't Changed</div>

<p>For obvious reasons, most of the sections below will be listing facts unique to Chuukogo. So before all that, I'll give a very rough semi-accurate summary here of what aspects of Japanese seem to have changed between Chuukogo and Kinseigo, and which haven't.</p>

<p>Chuukogo uses the same kana and kanji, but adds two kana (ゐ wi and ゑ we) and introduces several additional cases of alternate kana pronunciations (in Modern Japanese the only case is は being read wa).</p>

<p>The major meanings of the basic particles are the same in both. は and が still mark subjects, を still marks objects, で still marks means/method, と still marks quotes, か still marks questions (though now や does too), the annoying mess of meanings に has is basically the same, etc. In fact, all the particle meanings I would consider difficult are unchanged, so adapting to Chuukogo's particles is relatively easy.</p>

<p>Several particles have additional meanings in Chuukogo. For instance, は and を are now also sentence enders, の can also mark subjects.</p>

<p>There are a few particles which fell out of use after Chuukogo, like にて and やは, but these are outnumbered by more familiar particles.</p>

<p>A lot of the grammatical words in Chuukogo will look familiar, and many will also have similar meanings. A handful will be brand new though (including ones like なる which don't look new at all).</p>

<p>With Chuukogo's particles, grammatical words and verb forms, there is a much stronger tendency for a given meaning to be expressable in several different ways (there are about eleven ways to mark the cause or reason for an event), and for a single particle/word/form to have several different meanings at once (as you can see below, べし has seven meanings). To say it more pessimistically: there's a lot more needless overlap, and a lot more frustrating ambiguity.</p>

<p>A very large chunk of the vocabulary is the same, once you get used to alternate spellings caused by the alternate pronunciations and different conjugation system (e.g. かひなし is the same as 甲斐ない).</p>

<p>Of course, there's also a lot of vocabulary that changed significantly. In my experience, the familiar meanings of these words simply don't make sense in context, which should be enough of a clue to look them up.</p>

<p>Somehow, there seem to be almost no words that have sort of the same meaning but just changed in some subtle way to confuse you (many did change subtly, but so far not in ways that misled me at all).</p>

<p>The way clauses work is, as far as I can tell, essentially the same. The problem is that Chuukogo seems more fond of leaving lots of subjects and objects implicit (apparently referring to people by name was rude in the imperial court, so for all I know this issue might be unique to the Tale of Genji). Also, many of its particles, verb forms and transition words often act as if there's an implicit 事 or 状態 or ように or some other noun or phrase following them. Thus, it's much harder to "guess" how the clauses fit together even though the basic rules are the same. The most common implicit nouns/phrases for a given particle/form/word will be mentioned as part of its definition in the lists below.</p>

<p>The syntactic nature of verb forms is very similar. By that I mean that conjugating still consists of changing the last letter of a verb, attaching a suffix, and possibly repeating with the last letter of that suffix.</p>

<p>However, the majority of the verb forms you're familiar with don't exist in Chuukogo, and most of the verb forms in Chuukogo don't exist in Kinseigo. 
One exception is the -i form. Also, compound verbs were just as common back then as they are now.</p>

<p>A partial exception is the -eba form. I say partial because it's no longer a conditional form. Instead of "if _ then _", it now means "because" or "therefore". It's extremely common, so get used to this fast.</p>

<p>As mentioned on the Conjugation page, the jodoushi model of verb conjugation (the one the Japanese themselves use) is much better for explaining Chuukogo than the gaijin model you're used to, so I'll be introducing it below.</p>

<p>Chuukogo adjectives end in し in their default form, not い.</p>

<p>Also, Chuukogo verb forms tend to be noticably shorter on average, which is a major cause of the aforementioned overlap. For instance, the -a nu (negative) and -i nu forms (past tense, sorta) are spelled identically on 一段 and 二段 verbs. It gets worse when these forms are themselves conjugated: an -i te form might be a conjunctive -te, or it could be a form of the -i tsu form (another past tense, sorta). Surprisingly, it's not that hard to deal with this, but doing so often requires looking at what comes before and after each part of the conjugated verb, which is probably not how you're used to identifying forms. For instance, a conjunctive -i te would have no further inflections, whereas the -i tsu form changed to -i te must be followed by something (and yes, it's possible to derive most of that claim directly from the information I give below).</p>

</table>

<p>There are also some words which miraculously manage to have almost exactly the same set of meanings in both old and new Japanese. 色 is one example. I might try listing some of these later.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="Changes to the Kana">Changes to the Kana</div>

<p>First, the easy one: The ゐ wi and ゑ we hiragana actually get used, so remember them.</p>

<p>Now, remember how each kana has exactly one pronunciation, with the exception of は being read wa when it's a particle? Chuukogo has a lot more exceptions. 
Fortunately, most of the exceptions are reasonably intuitive: はひふへほをづぢゐゑ may be read as わいうえおおずじいえ respectively. I'm pretty sure there are a few others, but that covers the vast majority. As a quick example, the old way of writing 思います is 思ひたまふ, which would be read 思いたまう. Thankfully, conjugation doesn't add any complications to this. For instance, たまふ（たまう） has forms like たまはず（たまわず） and たまへば（たまえば）.</p>

<p>Finally, this isn't really a change to the kana, but it'll probably save you some headaches if I tell you about this now. There are a few kana, like で and だ, which you're used to seeing only as particles or in verb stems. But in Chuukogo, there are dzu-type verbs like 出づ（いづ） and まかづ which can conjugate to things like 出だぬ or まかでたまふ.</p>

<div class="guideheading" id="Common Particle Meanings">Common Particle Meanings</div>

<p>To deal with overlap efficiently, I'm going to use some Japanese terms for particularly common meanings.</p>

<p>1) 感動語尾 - a sentence ending particle used when the speaker is emotionally moved by the action (by the way, I made this one up, it's not a real Japanese term).</p>

<p>2) 逆説 - the word for "contradictory conjunction". In English these include "but", "however", "despite", "although", etc.</p>

<p>3) 原因助詞 - the words for "cause/reason" and "particle". Basically, any particle which (like the modern から) may mark the cause or reason for an action later in the sentence (I also made this one up).</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="Case Markers and 語尾 Gobi">Case Markers and 語尾 Gobi</div>

<ul>
<li>は is basically the same, though may be used to add emphasis, or as a 語尾 (without 感動).</li>
<li>も is basically the same, though it's also a 感動語尾.</li>
<li>を still marks objects, though sometimes it's a bit closer to と or から than you might be used to. It's also a 感動語尾.</li>
<li>に has all the same meanings as before, plus it's now a 原因助詞. When used at the end of a clause, it can be a 逆説.</li>
<li>へ is basically the same</li>
<li>と is basically the same, though it can also be used to list phrases for a comparison (＿と＿と...)</li>
<li>な has nothing to do with adjectives anymore, but its negative command meaning still exists, and it's also a 感動語尾.</li>
<li>の and が have all the same meanings they do in Kinseigo. But they also have each other's meanings (this was a big WTF moment for me). For instance, が can denote possession, and の can mark subjects. There are also some cases where it's easier to interpret an old の or が by assuming an implicit ように, もの or こと comes next.</li>
<li>から and より also have all the same meanings plus each others'. Of course, they're pretty close in Kinseigo already, so this isn't too bad. They also have a new meaning of "through".</li>
<li>や and やは mark questions. In addition, the question may be a rhetorical one with an implicit negative answer (＿か？いや、ないだろう）. や can also act either like よ/な, or like やら/など. I don't know how to differentiate between these uses yet.</li>
<li>か can mark questions or be a 感動語尾. かな is strictly a 感動語尾. かは strictly marks questions, possibly rhetorical ones with negative answers.</li>
<li>よ is basically the same as its modern usage.</li>
<li>ぞ is still a 語尾, though it can also be used to provide emphasis earlier in the sentence.</li>
<li>なり and たり are ordinary 語尾 if the verb is conjugated, otherwise なり has a different meaning (see next section).</li>
<li>にて can mark place/time (like に/"at"/"on"), means/method (like で), someone's situation/status (like として), or cause/reason (so it's a 原因助詞).</li>
<li>After a noun or clause, して marks means/method (like で), or a person or group of people who perform an action or are used to perform an action (sometimes overlaps with で).</li>
<li>After an adjective or a verb in its -i form, して is a 逆説, a 原因助詞, can mean "and", or mark a state/situation.</li>
<li>*ゆ and *よ can mean "through", "more than", から, or mark a beginning (in space or time). *ゆり is similar.</li>
</ul>

</table>

<p>Don't worry about the little "conjugation" parts for now. They'll be explained a few sections later. Last but not least, here are the tricky ones.</p>

<p>らむ/らん denotes present actions the speaker knows about secondhand, or is guessing are happening. This may also mark the cause of the action in the next clause. If the speaker does know about it firsthand, this asks why it's happening. Compare to -i けむ/けん below.</p>

<p>らし indicates an inferred cause of or reason for some event the speaker perceives directly.</p>

<table class="conjugation">
<tr><td>Conjugation:</td><td>＿</td><td>＿</td><td>らし</td><td>らし<br>らしき</td><td>らし</td><td>＿</td></tr>

<p>なり indicates an event inferred from noises or voices the speaker heard, or something they know through hearsay.</p>

<table class="conjugation">
<tr><td>Conjugation:</td><td>＿</td><td>なり</td><td>なり</td><td>なる</td><td>なれ</td><td>＿</td></tr>
</table>

<p>べし indicates likelihood/volition/intent/obvious truth/recommendation/order/possibility. Seriously, it can be any of those.</p>

<table class="conjugation">
<tr><td>Conjugation:</td><td>べから</td><td>べく<br>べかり</td><td>べし</td><td>べき<br>べかる</td><td>べけれ</td><td>＿</td></tr>
</table>

<p>まじ is the negative of べし, so it indicates unlikelihood/non-volition/non-intent/obvious falsehood/prohibition/negative order/impossibility.</p>

<table class="conjugation">
<tr><td>Conjugation:</td><td>まじから</td><td>まじく<br>まじかり</td><td>まじ</td><td>まじき<br>まじかる</td><td>まじけれ</td><td>＿</td></tr>
</table>

<p>り denotes actions that are complete, but whose effects persist (like ～て・ある). Since there are weird restrictions on when this form can and can't be used, the -i たり form (same meaning) is much more popular.</p>

<table class="conjugation">
<tr><td>Conjugation:</td><td>ら</td><td>り</td><td>り</td><td>る</td><td>れ</td><td>れ</td></tr>
</table>

<p>べし should look very familiar because its predicative form べき and to a lesser extent its negative form べからず (and べし itself) are still present in Kinseigo. Obviously, it has dropped a lot of those meanings over the past several centuries. I also suspect the modern まい form has a lot to do with まじ. </p>

<p>I don't know for sure how you're supposed to tell the difference between all the meanings of べし and まじ, but I suspect it's very similar to what you do with the -a mu form described below.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<h4 id="Verbs">Verbs</h4>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="Verb Categories">Verb Categories</div>

<p>Before, I defined "verb type" as the letter a verb ends in by default, which determines how its other forms are spelled. A "verb category" is a set of rules determining these spellings based on type. In Kinseigo, 一段 ichidan and 五段 godan are the only verb categories, and all 一段 ichidan verbs are -ru type anyway, so categories just weren't that important before.</p>

<p>In old Japanese, we have the categories 一段 ichidan, 二段 nidan and 四段 yondan (as far as I can tell 三段 sandan doesn't exist). Technically, 一段 and 二段 are each split into "upper" and "lower" categories depending on whether the stem's last vowel is i or e respectively. This doesn't actually affect how the verbs conjugate, so I will ignore it and write lots of "i/e"s instead.</p>

<p>There are also small categories for irregular verbs. カ変 is short for カ行変格活用 "k-sound irregular conjugation", meaning any irregular verb starting with か, け, き, こ or く (though the only verb actually in this category is く). Likewise, there are サ変, ナ変 amd ラ変 categories. Kinseigo has these categories too, but so few verbs are in them that it's usually not worth mentioning.</p>

<p>Also, adjectives are split into ku-type and shiku-type. In Kinseigo, it's often said there are i-adjectives and na-adjectives, but the vast majority of na-adjectives are really just nouns with a particle after them, so they kinda don't count. In Chuukogo, nari-type and tari-type adjectives are the same way, so I will be ignoring these.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="The Jodoushi Model">The Jodoushi Model</div>

<p>Now, as promised, I'll tell you the model that the Japanese use to explain Japanese verb conjugation. Long story short: everything that can be conjugated has exactly six basic forms. Depending on the verb/adjective/whatever, some of these forms may have no spellings (i.e. they can't be used at all) or multiple spellings (which are interchangeable), but usually it's one spelling each.</p>

<table class="conjugation">
<tr><th>Japanese Name</th><th>English Name</th><th>Usage</th></tr>
<tr><td>未然形（みぜんけい）</td><td>Incomplete Form</td><td>Like the -te and -i forms, this is used to make several complex forms</td></tr>
<tr><td>連用形（れんようけい）</td><td>Connective Form</td><td>The modern 連用形 is called the -i form in the gaijin model. The old 連用形 has the same uses, including forming compound verbs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>終止形（しゅうしけい）</td><td>Predicative Form</td><td>For verbs meant to end a sentence, i.e. verbs in the "main predicate". This also serves as the default/dictionary/infinitive form.</td></tr>
<tr><td>連体形（れんたいけい）</td><td>Attributive Form</td><td>For verbs at the end of a clause meant to describe a noun, i.e. "attribute" an action to it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>已然形（いぜんけい）</td><td>Conjunctive Form</td><td>Used by certain particles to express meanings like "since" and "however" (which are conjunctions in English).</td></tr>
<tr><td>命令形（めいれいけい）</td><td>Command Form</td><td>Exactly what it sounds like.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The Connective and Command Forms should be extremely familiar. The Incomplete Form is a bit odd, but similar enough to things you're familiar with that it shouldn't take long to get used to. The Conjunctive Form may look very odd now, but once you look at the itty-bitty table for it below, you should grasp it very quickly. Just so you know, the jodoushi model for Kinseigo refers to the 已然形 as the 仮定形 or "Hypothetical Form".</p>

<p>The introduction of the Attributive Form is probably the weirdest part, largely because in modern Japanese the Predicative and Attributive Forms are completely identical. For instance, the old verbs す and く had Attributive Forms する and くる, and nowadays we refer to those verbs as する and くる since their Predicative Forms have been phased out.</p>

<p>Because of this strong "only six forms" premise, we can give a concise and complete description of verb/adjective/whatever's conjugation by simply listing those six forms in the correct order. For instance, the six forms of す are せ (incomplete), し (connective), す (predicative), する (attributive), すれ (conjunctive), and せよ (command). In my Chuukogo dictionary, and many other books about Japanese written in Japanese, it's common to to list these in an extremely concise form such as: （せ・し・す・する・すれ・せよ）. In fact, I already put similar lists underneath some of the "grammatical words" listed above.</p>

<p>Now, why am I calling this the "jodoushi" model? Because most of the things you're used to calling "forms" are the result of attaching either a 助動詞 jodoushi or a particle to one of the six basic forms. A jodoushi is any non-lexical word (i.e. "particle" in the broadest sense) that can itself conjugate to the six forms. Thus all of the "grammatical words" above that I attached a list of conjugations to are actually jodoushi. For the rest of this page, "particle" specifically means non-lexical words that don't conjugate (though hopefully that was already part of your intuitive definition).</p>

<p>For instance, in Kinseigo, what we've been calling the "negative form" is actually the result of attaching ない (a jodoushi) to the Incomplete Form (走らない = 走ら + ない), and what we've been calling the "hypothetical form" is actually the result of attaching ば (a particle) to the Hypothetical Form (行けば = 行け + ば). As a direct result, the grammar guide that came with my Chuukogo dictionary was essentially just a list of particles and jodoushi.</p>

<p>Okay, we're finally done with the conceptual foundation, so we can move on to some real conjugation. Since there's only six forms now (and I'm no longer treating verb types separately since I'm sure you can deal with that by now), there's no reason not to just throw up a complete conjugation table.</p>

<p>This particular table is a heavily altered version of one I stole from <a class="underscore" href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/中古日本語#.E5.8B.95.E8.A9.9E.E3.81.AE.E6.B4.BB.E7.94.A8">wikipedia</a>. I bring that up only because, if you want to learn more about the jodoushi model itself, separately from Chuukogo, that link is a good starting point.</p>

<hr class="dotted">

<div class="guideheading" id="List of Chuukogo Verb Forms">List of Chuukogo Verb Forms</div>

<p>Within the jodoushi model, I use "verb form" to refer to certain combinations of one of the six basic forms with either a particle or a jodoushi. Specifically, I mean those combinations where the particle/jodoushi must be attached to a verb (not a noun) conjugated to a specific non-infinitive form (so べし, まじ, etc don't count). That may sound a little confusing and arbitrary, but this matches the intuitive distinction between "grammatical words" and "verb forms" that I've used in the main guide, so it's worth using here too.</p>

<p>Only three of the non-infinitive verb forms actually apply here. The 終止形 doesn't count because it's the infinitive form, and I ruled that out. The 命令形 doesn't count because nothing attaches specifically to it (of course some particles can come after it, like と, but those can come after anything). The 連体形 doesn't count because every particle that attaches to it also attaches to nouns (in fact, when you see a "clause-ending particle" in old Japanese, it's often a good idea to assume an implied noun).</p>

<p>So, using my (purportedly intuitive) definition of "verb form", all complex forms are based on 已然形, 未然形 and 連用形. This should be very comforting, since the 未然形 and 連用形 are analogous to the -te and -i forms you're used to, and the 已然形 only makes two extremely specific and easy to remember forms. Let's get 已然形 out of the way first.</p>

<h4 id="Examples">Example(s)</h4>

<p>Obviously, it would be stupid for me to try and write my own sentences, so I'll be taking a handful of lines I like from Genji or the example sentences in my dictionary. By "expert translation", I mean a translation provided by the book I found the sentence in.</p>

<p>The biggest reason I chose these sentences is that I'm pretty sure I actually understand how all the parts add up to the translation provided. Admittedly, a few things about them still puzzle me, and are thus ignored in my explanations, but considering I've only studied Chuukogo for one or two months total, that's unavoidable.</p>

<p>Old Japanese: かなはざりける命のほどぞ尽きせずうらめしき。</p>

<p>Step-by-step Parsing: The first word is the verb かなふ, which in this case is the same as 叶う（かなう）. It's conjugated to the -a ざる negative form, then the ざる conjugated to its past tense -i けり form, and finally that けり to its predicative form ける because it's being used to describe the noun phrase 命のほど. Thus, かなはざりける is equivalent to 叶わなかった.</p>

<p>For 命のほど, we have to remember that ほど can mean 時間. Essentially, this phrase is meant to refer to the length of a life. The particle ぞ at the end is just emphasis (though it should sound very weird). Next, 尽き and せず are more or less the same as modern Japanese: "exhaust" and "to not". In this case, their combination means something like 限りなく. Finally, うらめし is the same as 恨めしい "reproachful", except it's in its predicative -ki form, because the phrase 尽きせずうらめしき is meant to be describing 命のほど. Notice that the presence of ぞ allows the 尽きせずうらめしき phrase to describe something retroactively without causing confusion.</p>

<p>尽きせずうらめしき phrase to describe something retroactively without causing confusion. 
Putting all that together, we have something like "the length of a life, which is such that (some wish) could not be granted, is infinitely reproachful." In the context of the story, the speaker is bemoaning the fact that his lover's life was too short for her to fulfill a promise they'd made.</p>

<p>Expert Translation to Modern Japanese: (その願いの)かなえられなかった命のはかなさが限りもなく恨めしいのである。</p>

<p>Old Japanese: 秋ならで妻よぶ鹿を聞きしがなをりから声の身にはしむかと</p>

<p>Step-by-step Parsing: First, the -a で form of なる is a negation. Second, the -i しがな form is kinda like -i tai, but with a "were it possible, I would love to _" nuance. From that, you can see how the first part of this sentence means "I would love to hear a deer call for his mate when it was not autumn."</p>

<p>Recall をり means "time". The から here marks a cause rather than a start. Notice the の particle is marking 声 as a subject. The verb しむ is basically 沈む. The かと is the same as modern Japanese. So the second part means "I suspect that voice sinks into my body because of the time", where "time" refers to the season of autumn and "sinks into my body" means exactly what you'd expect.</p>

<p>Expert Translation to Modern Japanese: 秋以外の時に、妻を呼んで鳴く鹿の声を聞きたいものだな。秋という季節だからこのように声が身にしみるかと。</p>

<p>Old Japanese: 右近の司の宿直奏の声聞こゆるは、丑になりぬるなるべし。</p>

<p>Step-by-step Parsing: The first part of this sentence just requires you to know things, so focus on the more interesting second part once you read this. 右近の司 refers to a particular guard whose shift is at 丑 (1-3 AM). 宿直奏 refers to a guard announcing their name when their shift begins. 声聞こゆる is exactly what it looks like: "hearing the voice of (the guard saying his own name)".</p>

<p>Now the fun part. The first なる is the usual verb "to become", conjugated to -i nu form, the nu's predicative form adds a ru, to which the naru particle attaches (inferring event based on something heard, in this case the guard's voice), to which the beshi particle attaches (the subject is third person so interpret it as likelihood). Thus this adds up to "It's probably (based on what he heard) just about 1 AM."</p>

<p>Expert Translation to Modern Japanese: 右近衛府の宿直奏の声が聞こえてくるのは、もう丑の時になってしまっているのであろう。</p>

<p>Old Japanese: さるまじき御（おほむ）ふるまひもうちまじりける。</p>

<p>Step-by-step Parsing: さる is like ある, まじき is the attribute form of まじ. Together these mean something like "_ which should not be" which can be interpreted as "undesireable" or "inappropriate".</p>

<p>御 and ふるまひ are the same as おふるまい despite the weird spelling. も is a particle by itself. うちまじる is まじりあう and -i ける is past tense. So the whole line is "Inappropriate behavior was mixed in", which, based on the context I haven't transcribed, means "Sometimes he acted inappropriately."</p>

<p>The とか in the expert translation probably reflects the fact that ける is for secondhand knowledge.</p>

<p>Expert Translation to Modern Japanese: 時には不都合なおふるまいもなくはないのだったとか。</p>

<p>Old Japanese: おのづからかしこまりもえおかず、心の中（うち）に思ふことを隠しあへずなむ、むつれきこえたまひける。</p>

<p>Step-by-step Parsing: おのづから is like "by onself" in modern JP, here it's like 自然と "naturally". かしこまる here means something like "to be respectfully quiet". There's an え＿[negative], meaning "unable to _", around an おく, which here means "to remain as is". Thus this phrase means "it naturally became such that they were unable to remain respectfully quiet".</p>

<p>心の中に思ふこと means exactly what it looks like: "what they felt in their hearts". 隠す also means "hide" as usual. The tricky part here is that the -i あふ form is using 堪ふ instead of 会ふ, so 隠しあへず means "cannot endure hiding". The なむ is emphatic.</p>

<p>Finally, 睦れ means "intimately" (recall 睦まじい) and this きこゆ is one of the many meaning "say" rather than "hear". The -i たまふ is just formality, and -i ける is past tense. So this part means "they spoke intimately".</p>

<p>Expert Translation to Modern Japanese: お互いに胸の中のことも包みきれず話し合うといった具合に、親しみ申されるのであった。</p>

<p>Old Japanese: 「その片かどなき人はあらむや」とのたまへば、「いとさばかりならむあたりには、誰（たれ）かはすかされ寄りはべらむ。」</p>

<p>Step-by-step Parsing: 片かど is 片才, meaning a meager talent/skill. 片かどなき thus means "without even the slightest talent". The -a mu form indicates likelihood since the subject is third person. Notice that や marks a question here. So this part means "Is it probable for such a talentless/worthless person to exist?"</p>

<p>The のたまふ means おっしゃる. Remember the -e ば is not "if" but "because".</p>

<p>いと means "very". さばかり means それほど. あたり means what you think it does. In this case, the -a mu form is best read as という, and さばかりならむ is referring to the phrase 片かどなき in the previous quote. So the literal is "a (hypothetical) place that is _ to such a great degree". Plug in the reference and this becomes "a (hypothetical) place with such a worthless person".</p>

<p>In context, this is Genji and his caretaker talking about court ladies in the imperial palace, so what this phrase really means is "a place with such a worthless woman".</p>

<p>誰（たれ） still means "who?", the pronunciation is just older. すかす means うまいこといってだます. 寄る still means "to visit", and はべる is simply a formal verb. Once again, the -a mu is likelihood. This adds up to "Who would be deceived into visiting (such a place)?"</p>

<p>Expert Translation to Modern Japanese: 源氏は「一つの取り柄もないという人がいるものだろうか」とおっしゃると、中将は、「まったく、それほどひどい女がいるとしたら、そんな所には、誰がだまされて寄りつきますか。」</p>
