<p>Traveling to Japan to talk with natives, watching raw anime, and reading manga and novels before they're translated all require the same fundamental skills and knowledge. While this guide is not going to be enough to teach you these skills, it will give you an idea of how to go about acquiring them.</p>
<p>With the basics covered in this guide you can get started with reading the written language, which you can then use to gain a more thorough understanding of Japanese. That being said, you should not hesitate to practice listening or speaking if you wish to do so. This guide only aims to introduce you to the Japanese language and show you how to get started. The rest is up to you.</p>

<p>The Japanese writing system consists of three scripts: hiragana, katakana and kanji.</p>
<hr class="dotted">
<div class="guideheading" id="The kana">The kana</div>
<p>Hiragana and katakana, together referred to as the kana, are two phonetic scripts, each containing 46 characters. They represent the same sounds, but are used for different purposes.</p>
<p><em>Hiragana</em> (ひらがな) is used for grammatical parts and words which have no kanji form, or which the writer chooses not to use kanji for. <em>Katakana</em> (カタカナ) is used for loanwords and emphasis (similar to italics), among other purposes. For more information, see Tae Kim's articles on <a class="underscore" href="../grammar/taekim.html#_Hiragana">hiragana</a> and <a class="underscore" href="../grammar/taekim.html#_Katakana">katakana</a>.</p>
<p>Hiragana will be your bread and butter for reading anything in Japanese. The approach to Japanese presented in this guide, as well as all the resources linked (except for those about the kana), are intended for people who can at least read hiragana. Thus, hiragana is the first thing that you are expected you learn.</p>
<hr class="dotted">
<div class="guideheading" id="Kanji">Kanji</div>
<p><a class="underscore" href="guide/kanji.png">Kanji</a> are the third part of the Japanese writing system, and by far the most extensive. These logographic characters of varying complexity represent parts of words, or sometimes whole words. Japanese high school students are required to learn at least 2136 kanji as part of the curriculum, but up to around 3000 are used somewhat regularly in modern life.</p>
<img src="guide/1.jpg" />
<p>The above is an example from the manga series <strong><a class="underscore" href="../library/manga/series/ゆるゆり.html">ゆるゆり</a></strong> using hiragana, katakana and kanji.</p>

<div class="guideheading" id="Grammar">Grammar</div>
<p>Learning grammar is straightforward: Pick a grammar guide and read it. <a class="underscore" href="../grammar/taekim.html">Tae Kim</a> is often recommended for beginners (note that the whole guide is basic grammar, even the “advanced” section), but other options are listed on the resources page. You shouldn't expect to memorise everything you read the first time around in whatever guide you choose, but you should be aiming to understand it. The purpose of a grammar guide is not to grant you "mastery" over the language (which only comes through lots of practice and exposure), but simply to introduce you to the fundamentals of the language and give you the foundation that you need to start reading native material. </p>
<p>Once you've reached the end of the guide, you can start reading Japanese material while consulting back to the guide to solidify your memory. By reading Japanese you are actively practicing your grammar since you are using it constantly to understand what you are reading. Manga is the common recommendation for first getting into reading, especially <strong><a class="underscore" href="../library/manga/series/よつばと！.html">よつばと！(Yotsubato)</a></strong> with the <a class="underscore" href="http://livingjapanese.com/pages/reading_packs.html">Yotsuba Reading Pack</a>. You may also consider doing the <a class="underscore" href="../grammar/dojg/dojgdeck.html">Dictionary of Japanese Grammar Anki deck</a> to reinforce what you have learned.</p>
<p>This isn't the end of grammar. Tae Kim should serve you fine for easy manga, but it only covers basic grammar. The Dictionaries of Japanese Grammar are the go-to resource for anything not covered in Tae Kim; they and various other options are documented in the <a class="underscore" href="#_Learning Resources">resources section</a>. If you're looking to reinforce or refresh what you learned in Tae Kim, then the <a class="underscore" href="../grammar/vjg.html">Visualizing Japanese Grammar</a> video series (written and presented by a native Japanese linguist) is an excellent resource.</p>
<hr class="dotted">
<div class="guideheading" id="Vocabulary">Vocabulary</div>
<p><a class="underscore" href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a> is a flashcard program that helps you acquire vocabulary through <a class="underscore" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a>. It is commonly used in conjunction with the <a class="underscore" href="anki.html">Core2K/6K</a> vocabulary deck by beginners to build up a basic vocabulary of common words in preparation for reading. Many people stop the Core2K/6K deck after reaching 2000 words; partly because the first 2000 words (Core2K) are a lot more common than the rest, and partly because of the significant time investment involved in completing Core6K. As you can expect even Core2K to take about 3 months to complete, some prefer to skip it and begin reading native material immediately. Whether or not you feel that the time investment is worth it depends on your tolerance for looking up unknown words. After finishing Core2K, you'll at least be able to recognize the majority of words in a given sentence, but you will still have to look up many words per page.</p>
<p>After completing Core2K (or skipping it entirely), some people begin a "mining deck". A mining deck is a vocabulary deck which you build up yourself with the unknown words that you encounter while reading. The browser add-on <a class="underscore" href="https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/">Yomichan</a> simplifies this process to a single click, so that all you need to do to add a card to your deck is hover over a word and click the + button in the popup.</p>
<hr class="dotted">
<div class="guideheading" id="Writing system">Writing system</div>
<p>You will need to learn all three writing systems to be able to read native material. Since hiragana and katakana are relatively small in number and simple in design, they can be learned through rote repetition in a short time-frame using a page like <a class="underscore" href="kana.html">this</a>. For kanji, however, because of their great number and complexity, there are various opinions on how to best approach them. </p>
<p>None of the methods described below are objectively superior to the others. The most important thing about any given method is not how "efficient" it is, but whether or not you enjoy it, or at the very least feel motivated enough to see it through to completion. Don't be afraid to try out different methods and see what works best for you.</p>
<hr class="dotted">
<div class="guideheading" id="Benefits and drawbacks of isolated kanji study">Benefits and drawbacks of isolated kanji study</div>
<p>There are two main ways to approach kanji. The simplest is to learn whole words without studying the individual kanji. The other is to study each kanji in isolation to learn its meaning and composition. Studying isolated kanji can grant you the ability to write by hand, and will likely make learning vocabulary easier. It's up to you to decide whether you'll benefit enough from learning kanji in isolation to merit the time and effort it takes.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that recognition and production are separate skills. Practicing one will make the other easier, but fluent recognition requires recognition practice, and the same goes for production if you wish to learn it.</p>
<hr class="dotted">
<div class="guideheading" id="Kanji through vocabulary">Kanji through vocabulary</div>
<p>If you choose not to study kanji in isolation, you will still learn to recognize their meanings and readings as you learn new words. Learning new words is something you need to do anyway, so many people skip individual kanji study altogether. Either approach will result in success so long as you persist, so the choice comes down to what method you personally find easier. If you don't want to study kanji, you can likely work through a vocab deck without doing so. But if you are slow to pick up on kanji while learning vocabulary or have poor retention, consider studying kanji individually. </p>
<hr class="dotted">
<div class="guideheading" id="Isolated kanji (mnemonics)">Isolated kanji (mnemonics)</div>
<p>The mnemonics method uses short stories or images to break down the kanji and make them easy to remember. Commonly used resources that encourage mnemonics are <a class="underscore" href="https://mega.nz/#F!8ExTGa4b!U45o8vbIAHE5yrkFqyvNlg">Remembering the Kanji</a>, <a class="underscore" href="http://www.kanjidamage.com/">KanjiDamage</a> and the <a class="underscore" href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/779483253">Kodansha Kanji Learner's Course</a>. Each has its own set of mnemonics and slightly distinct methods, so you should glance through each and pick whichever suits you — it's ultimately not that important. For more information and the necessary Anki decks, see the <a class="underscore" href="#_Anki">resource section</a> below.
<p>You can also study kanji in isolation without mnemonics by using an <a class="underscore" href="#_Kanji">KKLC or RTK deck</a> and ignoring the mnemonics — just be sure to learn the <a class="underscore" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_%28Chinese_characters%29">radicals</a> that kanji are composed of first. The general consensus is that the <a class="underscore" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji#Readings">readings</a> for the characters <a class="underscore" href="guide/readings.png">are better acquired through vocabulary</a>, so you should just focus on associating each kanji with its meaning.</p>
<hr class="dotted">
<div class="guideheading" id="Radical approach">Radical approach</div>
<img class ="dayimg" src="guide/image00b.png">
<p>For those who feel that methods like RTK and KanjiDamage take too much time, but don't feel confident diving head-first into kanji as with the kanji-through-vocab approach described above, one method to consider is simply dedicating a week or two to studying <a class="underscore" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_%28Chinese_characters%29">radicals</a> - the 200 or so building-blocks which make up the kanji. This approach, rather than teaching you to write and recognise a set of ~2000 common kanji, gives your brain the information it needs to mentally deconstruct the kanji it encounters into their base components, which may make it easier for you to both learn to recognise them and to avoid mixing them up with other kanji which look similar. In any case, it should stop your brain from seeing them as simply a bunch of random squiggles. You can find an Anki deck <a class="underscore" href="https://mega.nz/#!IAVVlBab!qQazRubQ3VZ_WjjLS4CclxYQF-6QGRtnmwd_zGBZpIo">here</a> which contains all of the radicals, along with their meanings in English.</p>
<hr class="dotted">
<h2 id="Now what do I do to actually learn Japanese?">Now what do I do to actually learn Japanese?</h2>
<hr class="dotted">
<p>※ Look up a chart of hiragana and katakana (such as these: <a class="underscore" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Table_hiragana.svg">hiragana</a> / <a class="underscore" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Table_katakana.svg">katakana</a>) and write each kana down a few times. You can practice with the <a class="underscore" href="kana.html">kana page</a>. Make sure that you have a firm grasp on hiragana before moving on the the next step. Katakana is also important, but it's fine to move on to the next step without having as firm of a grasp on katakana.</p>
<p>※ Core2K/6K is the generally recommended Anki deck for beginners who want to build up a basic vocabulary before they start reading. Learn how to use it from the <a class="underscore" href="anki.html">Anki startup guide</a>. You should also install <a class="underscore" href="https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/">Yomichan</a> (Firefox/Chrome) or <a class="underscore" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rikaichamp/">Rikaichamp</a> (Firefox) or <a class="underscore" href="http://rikaisama.sourceforge.net/">Rikaisama</a> (Firefox pre-57+)  , which will allow you to look up words by hovering over them.</p>
<p>※ If you wish to study kanji or radicals individually, pick one of the methods discussed <a class="underscore" href="#Benefits and drawbacks of isolated kanji study">above</a>. You can do so either before starting vocab or at the same time, but you should try to finish up in a few months so you can focus on vocabulary.</p>
<p>※ Since you will probably be learning vocabulary alongside grammar, it is important that you pace yourself. This does not mean that you should not push yourself though. You can change the amount of new cards a day in Anki, but leave it at the default amount for the first few days and see how it suits you. Raise the amount of cards if you feel like you have headroom, and lower it if you feel overwhelmed (or just push yourself harder). Once you get into the swing of things, your total cards to review will be around ten times the amount of your new cards per day (so 20 new cards per day would mean about 200 reviews per day). <strong>You should set the upper limit for daily reviews in the deck options to the highest number possible</strong>, because failing to do all of your reviews on schedule will interfere with Anki's spaced-repetition-system. If you have trouble keeping up, lower the amount of new cards instead of limiting your reviews.</p>
<p>※ To learn grammar, <a class="underscore" href="../grammar/taekim.html">Tae Kim's Grammar Guide</a> is generally recommended due to its brevity (other options can be found in the <a class="underscore" href="#_Learning Resources">Learning Resources section</a>). Read the entire guide, including the "Advanced grammar" section - it's all actually basic Japanese grammar. If you are struggling to understand Tae Kim's explanation about a particular grammatical concept, look it up in the <a class="underscore" href="../grammar/dojgmain.html">Dictionary of Japanese Grammar</a>.</p>
<p>※ Once you have read through your chosen grammar guide, you are ready to start reading Japanese. While it's not necessary, reading will be easier if you have reached 1000–2000 words in Core2K/6K at this point (you will have to look up a lot of words anyway, but having a basic vocabulary will make it less painful). If you intend to start reading with <a class="underscore" href="../library/manga/series/よつばと！.html">Yotsubato</a>, download the <a class="underscore" href="http://livingjapanese.com/pages/reading_packs.html">Yotsuba Reading Pack</a>, which will introduce you to all of the vocabulary used in the first volume of Yotsuba; this is particularly helpful for slang and slurred speech that can't be looked up in a dictionary.</p>
<p>※ At this point most people start a mining deck. A mining deck is a vocabulary deck to which you add unfamiliar words that you encounter while reading. You can also continue with the Core deck if you like, but it makes sense to create a mining deck once you start reading. To make mining easier, use <a class="underscore" href="anki.html#import">Yomichan's Anki integration</a>, or <a class="underscore" href="anki.html#import2">Rikaisama's Anki integration</a>, which allows you to create a new Anki card with a single click.</p>
<p>※ Read more. Reading will be slow in the beginning, but the more you practice the better you will get at it.</p>
<p>※ Enjoy compelling content.</p>

<h4>How long does it take to learn Japanese?</h4>
<p>A very long time.</p>
<p>Some will comment that, at a good pace, fluency is achievable in 4 years. Thinking in terms of “I have 4 years to become fluent” may help to prevent you from making the common beginner mistake of rushing, crashing and burning due to short term thinking (e.g. setting your new cards/day limit to 100 in Anki because you think it is taking too long to get through your deck, then finding yourself totally overwhelmed in a week's time and giving up).</p>

<p><a class="underscore" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9987A659670D60E0">Namasensei</a> is often watched by beginners learning Japanese, because his alcohol-fueled antics are strangely both entertaining and powerfully motivating for some anons. Unfortunately, this is a double-edged sword; as he's always shitfaced drunk, tends to teach in an ineffective fashion, has terrible handwriting, and messes up the stroke order of some of the kana.</p>

<h4>How to find reading materials without torrenting?</h4>
<ul class="toc"><strong>Raw anime:</strong></ul>
<p>There are several ways to obtain raw anime. It may be noted that you can use hardsubbed (subs which you can’t turn off since they are on the video itself, not in a separate file) anime still, you’ll just have to cut off the lines where the subtitles are, which is a setting in VLC and probably many other video players. You can do this if you’re desperate and can’t find any raws. Explanation <a class="underscore" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dl4U8s-Dp4U">here</a>.</p>
<p>Piracy groups often release encodings of anime called "dual-audio", which means that you get the Japanese Audio, English Audio, and English softsubs (opposite of hardsubs, which is what you want). You can then just switch to Japanese Audio and turn the subs off. Often some English sub releases are softsubbed as well (like the releases from a group called "HorribleSubs").</p>
<ul class="toc">
<li class="toc"><a class="underscore" href="https://www.animencodes.com">animencodes</a>:  a listing of encodes of anime. Hosts on mega.nz, has a lot of dual audio. Cleo is a good encoder.</li>
<li class="toc"><a class="underscore" href="https://sites.google.com/view/anime-raws-list/home">Anime-Raws's Official List</a>: raws that are hosted on mega for AMV editors. Have a pretty decent collection, but here you should use with the English title.</li>
<li class="toc"><a class="underscore" href="https://snahp.it">Snahp.it</a>: a good piracy resource in general, most links are hosted on either mega or zippyshare. Also has a lot of dual audio releases.</li>
<li class="toc"><a class="underscore" href="https://animekayo.com">animekayo</a>: often uses google drive.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="toc"><strong>Raw manga:</strong></ul>
<p>Manga is a bit less complicated but it can be tricky when you are trying to obtain all volumes. Often volumes get bundled if the series is longer.</p>
<ul class="toc">
<li class="toc"><a class="underscore" href="https://cmczip.com">cmczip</a>: completely in Japanese and only supports Japanese titles. Try to download from different of those cheap hosters to get as much as possible until they lock you out (then you have to try again later). Also has scans of novels and magazines.</li>
<li class="toc"><a class="underscore" href="http://13dl.net">13dl</a>: very similar to cmczip.</li>
<li class="toc"><a class="underscore" href="http://manga-zip.net">manga-zip</a>: a broad selection and has magazine, uses sakurafile. The site also has English titles included.</li>
</ul>
<p>Should you not find what you are looking for, you can try [japanese name of manga]zip or [japanese name of manga]rar, but then keep your head up in order not to be scammed. But usually, almost everything is on one of these sites.</p>
<ul class="toc"><strong>Download manager:</strong></ul>
<p>Use a download manager such as <a class="underscore" href="http://jdownloader.org/jdownloader2">JDownloader</a> to download from the above to streamline the process.</p>
<p>To use JDownloader, you just copy the links to the file you want to download and it’ll find the files for you. For example, if it’s a mega link, just paste it into JDownloader. It can find a lot (you could also rip stuff from youtube that way, and so on, it’s pretty useful)</p>
<p>By default, it puts the files it found into a link collector in packages. You can move around stuff, delete links for stuff you don’t want, and mark certain things and right-click -> more options -> into a new package to put them in folders. By default, JDownloader saves into its folder (downloads/JDownloader, but you can change that) into a folder with the package name. Look through it, you can highly customize your results.</p>
<p>When you start to download something, just add it to to the download list and it’ll download. Many links can be continued from where they left off if you leave them; that’s marked by a circle made of two green arrows next to the download.</p>

<div id="What is the difference between x and y"></div>
<h4>What is the difference between x and y?</h4>
<p>Searching google for 「ｘとｙの違い」or 「"x" "y" "違い"」 will usually find you the answer you're looking for. If you can't understand the answer you find, you aren't on a level where you should worry about the difference of x and y yet.</p>

<div id="When should I start reading"></div>
<h4>When should I start reading?</h4>
<p>You can start reading as soon as you finish a grammar guide. Reading will be somewhat easier if you know 1000–2000 or so words, but you shouldn't delay it beyond that point. Your first attempt at reading will be difficult regardless of how many words you know.</p>

For a different study addressing the related question of how many words you need to know to achieve adequate comprehension, see <a class="underscore" href="guide/vocab_count.png">this image</a>.

<div id="These two words have the same reading and meaning"></div>
<h4>These two words have the same reading, and meaning. How do I distinguish them, and why is Japan trying to fuck me?</h4>
<p>They have the same English meaning. Which, in case you couldn't guess it, means you've gotta look it up in a J>J dictionary, or otherwise perform a Google search. If your grammar isn't at a level where you can understand the descriptions, or distinctions you should be bettering your grammar instead of your vocab. If you can only read English definitions, then assume they are flawed before assuming that you've been fucked.</p>

<div id="How do I choose which kanji reading to use"></div>
<h4>How do I choose which kanji reading to use? Should I learn onyomi and kunyomi of kanji?</h4>
<p>Readings for words are usually clearly defined, and any of the dictionaries in the sections above will tell you how a word is read. For more in-depth information on readings, refer to <a class="underscore" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji#Readings">this wikipedia entry</a>.</p>
<hr class="dotted">
<div id="Individual kanji study"></div>
<h4>Individual kanji study - production or recognition?</h4>
<p>Learning to recognise the meanings of a kanji does not equate to learning how to write it yet if you begin by studying only production, there will be times when you spot a character and think "Ah, I know this one!", but be unable to recall its meaning. In short, learning one skill will aid in learning the other, but to 'master' either skill requires dedicated practice of that skill.</p>
<p>What if you don't care about writing? It gives you a more intimate understanding of the kanji and will likely aid in your ability to distinguish similar looking characters and read messy fonts.</p>
<p>Importance here is ultimately subjective so ask yourself what matters and keep in mind that kanji study, unlike reading or listening, <em>can</em> be focused on at a later date without having a direct impediment on reading and listening comprehension.</p>

<p><a class="underscore" href="https://mega.nz/#F!Wk8VjJ6K!icqt2OiW4Vhle7q4cGUf_Q">Remembering the Kana</a> - It only takes about 6 hours to learn both hiragana and katakana alongside it because it provides mental images with the kana to ensure you remember. Download the book and/or follow this <a class="underscore" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2A25F7399E8805ED">video series</a> made by an RTK forum member.</p>
<hr class="dotted">
<p><a class="underscore" href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/tukkun/kana-warrior">Kana Warrior</a> - A game designed to help you recognise the kana. Best used alongside another method.</p>

<hr class="dotted">
<p><a class="underscore" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembering_the_Kanji_and_Remembering_the_Hanzi">Remembering the Kanji</a> (RTK) by Heisig - A book that teaches kanji in an order based on the radicals of each character. It starts you off with simple shapes and gradually goes into more complex ones. It teaches stroke order and makes up pretty fancy mnemonic stories to help you memorize the kanji easier. It does not teach the readings until the second volume nor does it tell you how the kanji are used in context. (Most people do not use the second volume and instead learn readings through vocabulary.) As such, this method expects you to learn all the common characters before even getting started on learning vocabulary. Of course, you can still start learning vocabulary while doing Heisig.</p>
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod"><a class="underscore" href="http://kanji.koohii.com/">Koohii</a> is a fansite that provides pre-made stories for RTK, generally superior to the ones in the book. (Note that some people find that creating their own mnemonic story can form stronger associations than trying to memorize someone else's.) You can access these stories more conveniently from <a class="underscore" href="https://hochanh.github.io/rtk/">this interface</a>. Do not use the spaced-repetition-system on Koohii; Anki is superior. There is an Anki deck in the <a class="underscore" href="../library/benkyou.html">library study resources page</a>. You'll also need to follow alongside the book PDF, since the deck does not teach the "primitive" kanji components.</li>
<li class="tod">Read more about it from <a class="underscore" href="http://rtkwiki.koohii.com/wiki/Remembering_the_Kanji">Koohii wiki</a> or <a class="underscore" href="taekim.html#_Kanji">Tae Kim</a>. <a class="underscore" href="https://nihongoshark.com/learn-kanji/">Here</a> is a detailed post about the mnemonic system, its advantages, and how to apply it, as well as how to incorporate Anki into it for added effectiveness (note: while this guy recommends using the kanji on the front of the card in Anki on the basis that it is easier, Heisig says, in all caps no less, in his book that <a class="underscore" href="guide/rtk.png">reviewing should only ever be done from the keyword</a>; the RTK deck in the Cornucopia of Resources has the keyword on the front of the cards, but is otherwise identical to the deck recommended on that page).</li>

</ul>
<hr class="dotted">
<p><a class="underscore" href="http://www.kanjidamage.com/">KanjiDamage</a> - Another kanji resource that uses a radical-based order. Unlike Heisig's method it also teaches the readings and gives you examples of common words that use those kanji (great for adding them to your Anki deck right away). Take the introduction on the site with a grain of salt, as it isn't very accurate, or is just plain wrong, as is the case with some other areas on the site, but that in no way makes this a bad resource in regards to learning. You may want to simply use the shared deck for Anki (see <a class="underscore" href="../library/benkyou.html">library study resources page</a>) instead of the website in tandem with another vocabulary deck in order to build up a big cache of words quickly.</p>

They're still there but often toned down or changed to something more logical/less crude. Some mistakes are fixed. Furthermore, the kanji base got significantly expanded, now the deck has 2136 cards (~1900 kanji, rest are radicals).  The deck can be browsed online <a class="underscore" href="../horon/kanji/kanjidamage.html">here</a>.</li>

Like RTK, it uses a mnemonic approach and teaches kanji components step by step. Unlike RTK, it teaches the most common kanji first, teaches their meanings through sample vocabulary rather than in isolation, and includes mnemonics for every kanji. (The RTK book stops providing pre-made mnemonics after the few first hundred kanji, but has a large number of community-made mnemonics available online.) Each entry includes 4 or 5 vocabulary words  to illustrate the kanji's meanings and readings. These words consist only of previously learned kanji, so you can make sense of the words right away, and also get constant review of kanji studied earlier. Use it with an Anki deck such as <a class="underscore" href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/779483253">this one</a>. The author maintains a website <a class="underscore" href="http://keystojapanese.com/">here</a> with information and supporting tools for KKLC users.</p>

<p><a class="underscore" href="https://mega.nz/#!IAVVlBab!qQazRubQ3VZ_WjjLS4CclxYQF-6QGRtnmwd_zGBZpIo">Kangxi Radicals</a> - An Anki deck with more accurate meanings for the radicals than other available resources. Comes with only recognition-style cards (radical on the front, meaning on the back) by default, but you can change them to recall-style cards (meaning on the front, radical on the back), because the deck disambiguates variants.</p>
<hr class="dotted">
<p><strong>For rote kanji study</strong>: Just pick whichever mnemonic deck (RTK/KKLC/KD) takes your fancy and edit the card layout to remove the mnemonics if necessary. The reason for this is that the mnemonic decks give much more concise meanings for the kanji, whereas rote decks often have far too many meanings to be realistically remembered for each kanji. It's worth doing <a class="underscore" href="https://mega.nz/#!uJsA1QwR!2z65jNf9lagIjvESUHHE-mMT3EXjfbRiBo91F9RpQwU">a radical deck</a> first so that if you encounter any kanji which you're really struggling to remember through rote, you can make up a mnemonic using the radicals.</p>

The region lock on radiko.jp appears to extend <a class="underscore" href="http://radiko.jp/#!/areafree">even to geographic areas of Japan</a> (meaning someone from Osaka cannot listen to radios from Hokkaido, etc.), though this lock can apparently be circumvented by purchasing a premium account on the site (assuming you can even use a premium account from a non-Japanese IP, which I'm not sure about). Using a VPN which can give you a Japanese IP address would allow you to circumvent region locks across all Japanese websites, but in the case of radiko.jp it seems that you would only gain access to radios in the vicinity of your Japanese IP address. </p>

<p><strong>Daijirin J-J Dictionary</strong> - Another authoritative Japanese dictionary, prefered by some to Kojien. To quote Wikipedia: "specifically created [...] to compete with Iwanami's profitable Koujien dictionary[...] One of the biggest differences between Daijirin and Koujien definitions is how they arrange meanings. A dictionary can arrange entries either historically with the oldest recorded meanings first (e.g., Koujien and Oxford English Dictionary) or popularly with the most common meanings first (e.g., Daijirin and American Heritage Dictionary). Daijirin entries encompass diverse vocabulary, including modern and classical Japanese words, scientific terminology, proper names, alphabetical abbreviations (like NG "no good; outtake, blooper"), and yojijukugo idioms. Some definitions include semantic notes distinguishing homonyms and synonyms." Currently in its 3rd edition (2006) which contains 238,000 entries. Note that some of its example sentences come from classical Japanese texts. Available online for free provided by Yahoo (also contains definitions from other dictionaries besides Daijirin, such as Daijisen - the definition page in question will say which dictionary it is giving the definition from). <a class="underscore" href="https://mega.nz/#F!UxhhlKzb!9T8-35RugwmkuZ33oTqVrQ">The EPWING version</a> can be read with <a class="underscore" href="http://rtkwiki.koohii.com/wiki/EPWING_software">EPWING viewers</a> like <a class="underscore" href="https://github.com/ludios/qolibri">qolibri</a>.</p>

<li class="tod"><strong>GNU/Linux users</strong>: run from the terminal with the following command:<br>
    <code>$ java -jar /path/to/KanjiTomo.jar -run</code></li>
<li class="tod">To increase accuracy, tell KanjiTomo what the text orientation and color are under the Settings menu. It is better to think of the text color settings as Dark on Light and Light on Dark than as Black on White and White on Black as the options actually appear.</li>
<li class="tod">While it is preferred to use ITHVNR when reading VNs (see Visual Novels section below), if you cannot use ITHVNR for whatever reason, it is possible to use KanjiTomo or other OCR programs with VNs instead. The best results will be had with VNs which use simple fonts with no weird outlines, effects, etc. applied to them, and which allow the user to reduce the transparency of the textbox (you usually don't need to make the textbox totally opaque; KanjiTomo can work surprisingly well with textboxes which have a fair amount of transparency to them, especially if you tell it what color font it's looking for as mentioned above - experiment and find the sweet spot).</li>

<p>To prevent KanjiTomo from stealing the window focus, change the following setting in the config file:</p>

<p><a class="underscore" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wine">Wine</a> - A FOSS compatibility layer that aims to allow applications developed for Microsoft Windows to run on Unix-like operating systems. Almost all VNs are made exclusively for Windows, so if you are a GNU/Linux user you will need this if you want to play any. Unlike virtual machines which consume a large amount of system resources, Windows programs run through Wine are no more resource intensive than they are when run natively on Windows. Note that ITHVNR only works in newer versions of Wine, so if you are stuck with an older version you may need to rely on OCR for word lookups instead.</p>
<div style="font-size:90%"> Tips:
<ul class="tod">
<li class="tod">Run VNs (or anything else Japanese) from the terminal with the following command:<br>
      <code>LANG=ja_JP.UTF-8 wine /path/to/vn.exe</code><br>
      (This is equivalent to having a Japanese locale on Windows, and without it you will get garbled text and likely other problems besides. You will need to generate a Japanese UTF-8 locale for your distro for this to work.)</li>
<li class="tod"><a class="underscore" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wine#WINEARCH">Generate a 32-bit Wine environment instead of a 64-bit one</a>. While, technically, so long as you have 32-bit libraries installed on your machine, 64-bit Wine should be able to run 32-bit programs, 64-bit Wine has undergone much less testing and thus contains a higher amount of bugs. Any VN you come across is almost certainly going to be a 32-bit program so there is no need to have 64-bit Wine anyway.</li>
<li class="tod">Use <a class="underscore" href="https://wiki.winehq.org/Winetricks">Winetricks</a> to easily install DirectX9, Visual Runtime libraries and so on. It is recommended as a minimum to install d3dx9_36, dotnet40, ffdshow, quartz and vcrun6, by issuing the following command from the terminal:<br>
      <code>$ winetricks d3dx9_36 dotnet40 ffdshow quartz vcrun6</code><br>
      You may also want to install takao and corefonts in the same manner if you have problems with fonts not displaying properly.</li>
<li class="tod">Add the location you use to mount .ISO and similar files to Wine as a CD-ROM drive. Open a terminal > type "winecfg" and hit enter > click the "Drives" tab > "Add…" > "OK" > "Browse…" > find the location in question and click "OK" > "Show Advanced" > Change "Type" from "autodetect" to "CD-ROM". This should stop VNs complaining that they can't find the files on the disk needed for installation and should avert the need for NODVD patches. You may need to pass "-o nonempty" as an argument when trying to mount .ISO files to this location after doing this, e.g.:<br>
      <code>$ fuseiso /path/to/vn.iso /path/to/mount/location/ -o nonempty</code></li>

<p><a class="underscore" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/VirtualBox">VirtualBox</a> - A FOSS program capable of creating virtual machines (emulated computers within your computer).

VirtualBox itself does not provide an installation media for Windows (or any other OS), so you will have to secure that yourself. As Virtual machines are resource heavy and generally unreliable when it comes to running anything graphical, it is preferred to use Wine if possible. Be sure to install the <a class="underscore" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html">Guest Additions</a> on your virtual Windows machine to improve performance and add support for 3D hardware acceleration, among other things.</p>
